thank you five people i appreciate that  i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat  shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through and then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its  to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find out  i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books  fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was  the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost   and everybody thought it was  this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was  the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was  you never know when you might need this and i was  but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success i grew up a lot this past year  this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and  hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was  oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was  oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was  all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had  we had we had so much chemistry he was  hey wassup i was  wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was  hey can you drop me off i was  where he was  at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was  oh no i just fucked a homeless dude again my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who   wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they  to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it  because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude  you feel  youre in a wes anderson movie or something and  white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff  voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff  that and its very  its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel  im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement  just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im  i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer  but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you  you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on  my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was  hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its  making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just  a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night  oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre  i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more  loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell  responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding  between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things  host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse   learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up  filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was  its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was  its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total  private school asians we both are big hippies too we  to backpack through southeast asia we  to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit  that  we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes  freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats  a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel  we are white people doing an impression of asian people  we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were  oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so  i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because  that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre  im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is  shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always  oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013  you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and  very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be  were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be  we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre  but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do  how much shittier food tastes when  you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be  look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im  that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retired i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day  youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically  wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre  oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks  its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to  squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want  its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was  you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently  and he was  hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was  why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes  mrs pacman just lets redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was   youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really  freaked out about anal and theyre  oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel  youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt  i got a second chance at life  i was  oh my god its  im going back in time \\u266a a whole new world \\u266a it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah  a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your\\u2013 just give your man a little\\u2013 a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari  and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont\\u2013 no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they  it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i  that fear that shit turns me on  especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye  hes discovered nirvana and its  youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim  my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when\\u2013 when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right  i respect you right im  yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who  to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their\\u2013 glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control   i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live  i just wanna be out of control for once just\\u2013 just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cunt im just waiting for the right moment to  become a housewife financially  i want my husband to get us to  a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people thats the kind of income bracket im striving for thats when  youve made it when youre eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple  what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking  a princess i have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be  guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are  thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me  a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were  ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was  yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won  another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were  why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was  yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed  a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and  why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were  yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im  oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here  i need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre  im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are  the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because  im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me  im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbusters i dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b  skittles so my uterus probably looked  a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act  everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich  mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were  oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was  only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be  were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its  release the kraken and they just come out  a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship  and  yeah and most of the time  we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be  ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look  they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be  hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymore im very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre  oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was   yeah where im from thats  losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was  no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was  yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was  you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted im scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula  what that is  what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did  that youre gonna poop on the table i was  yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense  that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channel i can already see how theres  this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommy  i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i  i berate my husband on  a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant  your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see  a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then  they get big\\u2013 they get big  fingers  you you you owe me money you my nipples look  whoppers now and naked i look  a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not  when i was  years old when it was  really hot  and i was  why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporin so  i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos  way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and  two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnant all right ive been ali wong have a good night everybody thank you your email address will not

hate them they hate them its  anthony why do you have to tell dead baby jokes why do you have so many dead baby jokes no one likes them why do you insist well ill tell you why because dead baby jokes have made me rich and who was it who was it who said the first million is the hardest was it hitler didnt see that one coming did you that was a good response most audiences just pretend i didnt say it but i  it i  making hitler jokes its cool for me i enjoy it hell i lost my grandfather i lost my grandfather in the holocaust museum it was the holocaust museum of modern art which is just  a normal holocaust museum except you walk around all day being  oh i should have thought of that my grandmother died about a year ago and i didnt think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away but i was wrong it was fine the hard part the upsetting part was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted she wanted to die in the best way possible   you radio winner whats the best way you can die this is not a trick question \\u2013 in your sleep \\u2013 yes thank you thank you everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep not me i want to be alert awake surrounded by friends in a house fire but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep we thought thats how she went we were all excited for her but then we did an autopsy found out she actually died horribly in the worst way possible during an autopsy it was fucked up yeah yeah she always said her grandkids didnt pay enough attention to her and and she was right she was dead on but i loved my grandma loved her very much my grandma taught me about a lot taught me what religion is taught me everything you can know about religion in one quick story ill tell you now when i graduated from high school when i graduated my grandma came to me gave me a big hug said anthony im so proud of you youre my first grandchild to get to go to college what can i do for you what can i give you before you go to college and i said honestly grandma all i need from you is money yeah i know you guys have never been but college is expensive and my grandma said  anthony i understand couple months go by its the end of summer im packing up my dads car getting ready to go to school and my grandma walks up says anthony here before you leave take this and she handed me a brandnew bible king james version and i said thanks grandma thats exactly what we talked about i got in the car and i went off to school couple of weeks go by im hanging out in my dorm room having a good time when the phone rings its my grandma anthony just calling to see how college is going grandma college is the best im having the time of my life but to be honest im starting to run low on money and i could use a little bit  we talked about she said  well let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said totally grandma im on chapter four she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later hung up the phone couple of months go by now im really starting to struggle financially might have to drop out of school so i call my grandma in a panic i say please its anthony im having the time of my life in college but if i wanna graduate and i do i need you to send me some money  we talked about she said anthony let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said yes grandma i wish it was longer and she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later finally its the end of the school year ive got straight as but im dropping out of college cause i have no more money left and im furious close to tears cleaning out my dorm room when the phone rings its my grandma anthony i heard youre dropping out of school today how come and i said  goddamn well how come grandma cause you wouldnt give me any money she said anthony let me ask you this did you read your bible and i just hung up the phone i was so pissed off took everything out of that room last thing i took off the shelf the last thing i took out of that room was that bible my grandma had given me took it off the shelf held it in my hands and for the first time i actually opened it up and on the very first page in my grandmothers handwriting it said fuck you thank you everyone i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight and all the jokes i write theyre all made up theyre all fake except for eric clapton and the challenger everything else everything else is fake but everything im about to tell you from here until the end of the show thats all true now i dont tell dark jokes because im a comedian im a comedian because i tell dark jokes im kind of fucked up all right ive always been this way i cant really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends its ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyones funeral i asked a friend for advice was  ive never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and dont tell a joke try not to so i walked up and was   what my favorite memory was when i was  four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it  mark twain out of my grandmas mouth it would just come to life and then i couldnt help myself i said and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the n word now i promise you i promise you until youve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wifes funeral at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think im one of the best comedians of all time but heres the thing it doesnt matter if you believe me it really doesnt matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i  to test myself i  to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i  to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i dont believe in too soon im on a tight schedule and im good at it im good at it  the day of the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted other than that how was the movie right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that the reason i get away with stuff  that is im just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didnt make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i dont follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying dont do it and whenever i see that whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad cause i know something horrible has happened people will say anthony whats funny about aurora whats funny about the boston marathon whats funny about your grandmothers funeral nothing nothing is funny about those things thats where i come in so i see these texts and im  oh no what happened but i also think ive got a job to do so i go online i start reading about it i dont want to watch the footage but ill read about what happened and i think how can i make someone laugh today and then i think i got it i go back on twitter and i tweet guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed especially the finish line and again i think nailed it usa usa but then my phone starts to ring and its my boss or should i say my former boss and they say anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today youre also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or youre fired and i say go fuck yourselves and i meant it i didnt get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because im dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said sure they said well anthony you dont understand you dont understand at all if you dont take this joke down right now if you dont delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people theyre also out of a job and im ashamed to tell you this im embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke cause im happy to fight for what i believe in im happy to take the consequences for what ive done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet couldnt do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now ill tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in im just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture theyre  anthony were family why are you so upset cant you see we did you a favor dont you worry about your career let me ask you san francisco do i seem  i worry about my career no  why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if theyre worried about their money they wouldnt have played the lottery in the first fuckin place i do not worry about my career and they said anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems  youre making fun of the victims and thats wrong but thats not what im doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell me im wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking hey are we trending no this is who im making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston do  what thats worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying dont forget about me today dont forget about me lots of crazy distractions in the news but dont forget how sad i am those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of theyre  a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understand now im sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it its fine its embarrassing but its fun you can laugh at yourself its not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me thats fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess thats what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called shark party all right now some of you enjoyed it but if youve never seen shark party you can never see shark party its been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year  million sharks are killed by human beings every year   people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack im  fuck yeah win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say  what i want to have a shark party as soon as theres a shark attack were having a shark party and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do ive already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark its time for a shark party lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing ive ever said on television smile you son of a bitch shark party and in america where im famous for those types of shenanigans everybody was  anthony that was fucked up it was fucked up to see you dance end of controversy however in new zealand where they dont get my show theyve never seen me and frankly they dont get out much the new zealand media takes the video and they show it to the guys family and they say what do you guys think about this and they say crikey or whatever the fuck they say over there the point is all of new zealand all of new zealand rises up against me all  of those cunts rise up and start threatening my life now i dont read the things that people write about me on the internet but i pay people who do and they come to me and theyre  weve got some terrible news please sit down they say you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of shark party and i was  really new zealand wants to kill me thats weird because they didnt even kill the shark i said how many death threats am i getting and they were  oh all of them you are getting all of the death threats what do you want us to do we can send someone to talk to them extra security what do you want i said no forget about it leave it alone dont worry this might be hard for some to understand ive said it several times tonight everyone is going to die i know full well i am going to die and most of us dont get to choose how we check out but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes best case scenario if somebody murders me over one of my jokes i immediately become a legend im a comedy god the mount rushmore of comedy is me four times i said come on then my security guys are   anthony well just so  that is the dumbest thing weve ever heard but youre the boss  and they leave and then the next day they come back and they say anthony sorry to bother you again i know you didnt care yesterday but its gotten much worse youre gonna wanna hear this they say someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dads phone number and address in pittsburgh posted that online and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand and i have to admit that had never occurred to me before it never crossed my mind that my family my loved ones would ever pay the price be caught in harms way for something ive done or ive joked about and honestly i would cut my throat for my jokes i would give my life for what i do but if anyone and i mean this for a fact if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke ive made even better this man is fantastici watched the show  times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable  great material so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is  but a joke about a famous musicians son falling to his death isnt  where are your

ladies and gentlemen make some noise for ronny chieng     thank you thank you hawaii im turning  so im harvesting my wifes eggs this year im harvesting my wifes eggs so that we can make embryos so we can freeze the embryos so that we do not have to have kids right now because kids are what you have when youve given up on your own hopes and dreams  im still trying here i look at my friends who are my age who have kids and they all look  shit  its gotten to the point where i cant even take a photo with them and post it on my main grid because it messes up the aesthetics of my instagram too much with their fucking haggard faces just drooping wrinkly crowsfeetembedded heads receding hairlines just withering graying hair coming out in clumps because of their children  i did a show and someone i went to high school with in singapore came to the show and after the show i met up with them and they brought another person with them and i was  oh is this other person your mom thank you so much for bringing your mother to my show and that other person was also someone i went to high school with  thats how fucking ugly  these people have become because of their children just unrecognizable so im trying to use money and science to push the curve back a little bit and  first step of harvesting my wifes eggs is i have to inject my wife twice a day for two weeks so i have to inject my wife i am the one injecting my wife twice a day for two weeks zero medical training i was given no medical training whatsoever the government lets you do this the the doctor asked me to do it the doctor was  hey have you ever held a needle before no perfect here take this and inject your wife in the middle of her body  nicolas cage in the rock  twice a day for two weeks with chemicals that we mail to you mystery chemicals that we send to your house in unmarked brown boxes just trust us that its the right thing that youre injecting into the person you love the most internet chemicals that show up it comes in a powder i have to make it into a liquid you understand its a meth lab in my kitchen as im mixing the comp im sweating the whole time cause im scared ill fuck up the measurements and kill my wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely then you have to  the air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements and then you have to put it in the syringe then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude   what youre doing   i dont know what im doing i saw someone do this on doogie howser   i dont even know the angle to put it into her   it looks so painful going in  i love my wife so much i cant even bear to watch her in pain i couldnt even bear to watch the needle go into her i had to inject my wife  this i had to  cover my eyes and  backhand it  into her  kurosawa  did i get the middle of your body no  just walk into the needle  im supposed to do all the work here meet me halfway and  the doctor said if you do everything right if you measure correctly you inject at the right times they scan  this part of her body  that chicago bulls logo right and they were   if you do everything right based on what we can tell you should expect  eggs  and my wife ended up getting   yeah always a  yeah always  a late halfhearted response to  usually the women in the crowd are  whoo yeah all the men in the crowd are always   is that a good number is  a good number of eggs how many eggs equal one bebe is it four eggs is one bebe so  eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together let me put this in a language that men can understand  twentysix eggs from one vagina in one cycle is mvp numbers  twentysix eggs is  if magic johnson averaged the tripledouble and killed his own aids   thats the level of medical miracle thats happening in whatever this part of my wifes body that horn of the bull that  curls into itself the doctor  scraped out  eggs out of my wifes vagina  salmon roe just scooping out just dripping out and then you put it in some nigiri right and then you eat it thats how babies are made you gotta salt bae the eggs onto the ikura and then you eat it so  were trying to make embryos so eggs thats just half the equation i dont know if  how embryos are made but eggs thats just half of it she did her part admirably so now i have to contribute my half of the embryo equation so im sitting in the doctors office   a wet pigeon all right and the doctor comes over and the doctors a woman because of course she is shes  good morning mr chieng so  whens the last time you ejaculated my wife is right here and shes  yeah when is the last time you ejaculated  we would all  to know its the one time in life where youre not allowed to lie about jerking off its when a medical professional is asking you a direct question and its for reproduction its for the intended purpose so you gotta tell the truth so im  whatever ill tell the truth  let me check my calendar   i guess the last time i ejaculated was  let me see  yesterday around  pm  and my wife is  yesterday i was with you all day  and i was  yeah but remember when you took out the trash   because i also put up mvp numbers against a shot clock and heavy defensive pressure but i was thinking of you the whole time its really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever vietnamese people eat my wife is vietnamese ive no idea what the fuck she eats n\\u01b0\\u1edbc m\\u1eafm  and i went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off its the medical jerkingoff room every hospital has a medical jerkingoff room  its nondescript not a lot of signage smaller than i think it should be lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt and im sitting in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and theres grown men outside the door waiting for me to finish  so they too can use the medical jerkingoff room that we are sharing  a wework  and im in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and i couldnt go  sorry sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand im sorry sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me sorry sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters as they code to death painfully and the families crying in the waiting room wasnt turning me on  so i couldnt go i couldnt go so i just call  right im    im  these people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room  i call the doctor back in and im  doc i cant go  i cant medically ejaculate under these circumstances the vibes are off let me go home let me go home to medically ejaculate can i do that and the doctors  yeah you can go home but  as soon as it comes out of your body it expires quicker than avocados in hawaii  youve got  you have  a  window before theres  an exponential decreasing probability of  im   fine ill go home ill medically ejaculate ill come back in  minutes no problem so i go home open the front door ejaculate immediately  this is   this is home court advantage i know where everything is i know whats behind me i look at the dripping garbage bag  its  a pavlovian response at this point  i ejaculate into a cup  its a cup that they gave me its not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen  that says worlds best dad on it  its the cup that they use doctors give you to test your pee for drugs its got a really tight cap right so i ejaculate into the cup it keeps overflowing so i gotta keep  pouring it out  just overwhelming amounts  its  ghostbusters  up in here   i fill it to the brim and then i scrape off the top and then i and then i seal the cap as tight as i can right get it really nice and tight and then i i put it inside my tshirt next to my skin under my armpit nice and snug because the doctor told me to do that because apparently  the titanic your body heat will keep your people alive and then i run downstairs and i jump into a new york city taxi and im  take me to langone hospital please hurry up the taxi driver is  what the fuck are you doing with your hand are you  im  oh yeah no im fine no its not me its my my wife shes wait a person its my jizz  and new york city taxis have seen much worse so the taxi driver was  oh  cool thank you for using a cup  unlike the last two dudes who were back there just raw dogging at the jfk  what im saying and  we get to the we get to the hospital right i open the taxi door i run into the hospital and because its new york city someone on the sidewalk is  hey yo hey yo were you that guy in shangchi  am i yes i was a minor character in the marvel movie shangchi not the main guy and the guys  yo yo can i get a photo with you and im   sure  so we take a photo  this so someone on the internet has a photo of me and this stranger and im doing this  napoleon if you ever come across this photo just know i am holding my own jizz  so feel free to tag it  he was very grateful he was  aw thanks so much man and i was  no problem man i shake his hand right  because i love meeting my fans and i run into the hospital right already hitting the  mark end of the fourth quarter theres no time left on the clock so i just take my jizz and i just throw a buzzerbeater right the doctor  catches my jizz    odell beckham she just  one hand grabs it and  in the same motion without even putting it down she  alleyoops my jizz into my wifes eggs right just takes it and she goes boom shakalaka and  my sperm goes into my wifes eggs and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg nobody knows its a mystery its a mystery of the universe nobody knows when sperm goes into the egg its unknowable ooh its its  the event horizon on a black hole no one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes nothing happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes it becomes a bubble tea  nobody knows where bubble tea comes from its tapioca the sperm goes into the egg and then you shake it and you go to vegas you throw it on the crap table and if youre lucky if you get a good dice roll right it becomes a blastocyst thats what we call future humans blastocysts it becomes embryos the doctor shell take all the embryos and shell look at them under the microscope and shell grade the embryos  cocaine  shell be  ooh yeah these ones these are agrade embryos right here   these ones these are these are bgrade embryos so so i dont know  these these ones these are cgrade embryos  oh and these ones yeah these these are these are dgrade embryos yeah these these will storm the capitol someday  so  you dont want that and then  and then you have to  draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics and you dont know youre just projecting data you just hope youre not throwing away a tom brady in the  round thats going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you cant measure the human spirit and  we all  to think were good people in this room but were all picking the agrade embryos  no one here is not picking your agrade embryos if given a choice even if you were a bgrade embryo  you would still pick your agrade embryos because youll be  i know what its  im not putting my kids through this bgrade human existence with sweaty palms and sciatica  give me the agrade shit give me the best we could do give my kid a fighting chance and it got me thinking about the future a little bit because i never wanted kids i never thought i would have kids the only thing i ever wanted to do my whole life was this standup comedy in america  its the best look at this its the best you are cheering because  this is way better than having kids   so much more fun and lucrative well the blastocysts are real now theres eight of them waiting for me in the cloud   chance of successful implantation with gradea embryos so i guess that makes me a mass murderer in alabama it got me thinking about the future what kind of parent am i gonna be am i gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were or am i gonna be better than my parents were be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck youre supposed to be now and thinking about it turns out im gonna be just as bad as my parents were i can i can feel it i can feel it inside me i can feel the i can feel the chinese inside me i can just feel that high expectation just low tolerance for excuses its in here its right in here its  the default app  you cant delete the calculator app theres no x when you shake it theres no x you can move it off the home screen but its still in the os embedded  in the operating system i can feel the chinese if my blastocyst was real if it entered this reality and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever oh my god look at this blastocyst everybody look look at how beautiful this blastocyst is i love you so much blastocyst i love you much more than i thought i would  and your blastocyst is hugging you back right theyre   i love you too daddy daddy daddy when i grow up i want to be a standup comedian just  you  i just feel the chinese coming on right i just  you take your glasses off  hitler in the bunker  standup comedy are you out of your fucking mind  thats not even a real job what do you think is gonna happen just gonna run around america and tell jokes to strangers who dont give a fuck about your mental health and even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds and make it to even a semiprofessional level as a standup comedian do you think theres any chance in hell youll be funnier than me    dad is a borderline arena act in some markets have you seen my imdb page im in everything i will fucking crush your career osoto gari your mother and i just spent a fortune to make an agrade blastocyst for them to become a bgrade comedian i will never watch anything you do go to law school   is what my father said to me  i do think its tough for straight men in  to sincerely look up selfimprovement on the internet without five weeks later storming the capitol  that mens selfhelp youtube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now  im not saying its the biggest problem in the world clearly but it is a problem  because men were genetically predisposed to seek selfimprovement  were trying to be better people every day believe it or not women  once we hit a certain age  usually we die before then through suicide or environmental factors bmx biking dietary choices but if you can live long enough as a man you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective  you start seeking guidance from outside sources you start looking at watches   every man in this room has or will at some point weve all been there guys weve all done this weve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives and weve been  what a fucking piece of shit  i fucking hate this loser look at this loser fuck this loser i hate this person i need to be a better person let me start by getting fit   let me work on my health that seems  a logical place to start my journey let me control what i can control in here so what do you do as a man you go on youtube right you look up how to lift weights right you press enter you click on the first video its some guy doing kettlebell swings right hell teach you how to lock your core so you dont break your fucking spine and then you do that for two days you feel pretty good about yourself  whoo right and on the third day the same youtube channel has a new video notification alert the men are  whats this new video from kettlebellswinging guy what could he be doing in his new video in the video the kettlebellswinging guy hes doing the new kettlebell exercise the lawnmower hes doing that and then   seconds into the video he just suddenly just stops and he looks really sad and he puts the kettlebell down and he looks straight into the camera and hes  yo guys just real talk for a second all right  kettlebells are great but i just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind  and all the men watching this are  yeah  yeah that makes sense that feels right in here tell me more kettlebellswinging guy  what other advice do you have for all areas of my life including my relationships and financial investments please give me guidance kettlebellswinging guy so what do you do you watch his next video on autoplay then you watch his next video here comes the youtube algorithm with a suggested video and here comes another suggested video and a week later jordan peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men  five weeks later youre storming the capitol dressed  a buffalo    thats a very realistic sequence of events by the way thats not even an exaggerated timeline every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm we all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that mens selfhelp andrew tate masculinity youtube selfhelp algorithm if you dont know anyone who lost their mind  youre the one who lost their mind youre currently in an echo chamber of assholes cause real friends tell you when youre losing your mind its very tragic all these men who are trying to be better people and theyre seeking guidance but that youtube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves theres tragedy in that  all those people they were just trying to lift weights  they werent trying to cause an insurrection they didnt even know what that word meant they were just trying to do this theyre trying to do this they didnt know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis\\u00e0vis their torso right is it  degrees or  degrees  is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you they googled it one time and then five weeks later youre taking a shit on nancy pelosis desk  and the us marshals are garnishing your wages because you take one wrong turn and life moves pretty quick im not saying as a man dont take responsibility for your own actions  im just saying that youtube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys it it sucks men in in a way that i dont think women understand it really preys on that mens need to seek guidance from somewhere its very hard to resist it just draws draws you in thats why fucking mark zuckerberg is trying to mma fight elon musk right now  that guy fell for his own algorithm do you understand mark zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd and for   years now hes just been looking at our data right jerking off every single day just looking at our data jerking off money piling up billions of dollars data jerking off money money jerking off data for  years that loop and who knew after two decades of that one day he just looked at so much data he was  oh shit oh shit he fell into it now hes trying to mmafight elon musk that guy jerked off and came on his own face   its out of control zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality and he invented that shit and he still fell for it what hope does the average man in america have just walking just waddling down the street looking looking for a taco on his phone hes gonna get sucked into his phone he has no chance that fucking guy has no chance because even the good guys in this room were all  on a razors edge to being a piece of shit   that margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razorthin i gotta tell you if you have the means every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge and  what an instagram post could push it either way   it depends on the post was it cute animals or was it boobs  thats gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours i do think as a society we need to  do a better job of identifying  when we have a disagreement with someone whos genuinely trying to have a goodfaith discussion to reach higher understanding and whos just talking shit we are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit and were not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics  for example me right now im just talking shit   this is oneway shittalking i dont care about any of your opinions do not send me any of them i do not care you paid for me i didnt pay a cent for any of you    free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shittalking session if you dont  it take it out on adam smith but if i was having a conversation with someone i disagree with in good faith i would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with thatd be a logical place to start a difficult conversation for example maga make america great again they have a point americas not doing so great right now right our kids math scores are down  our childrens science scores are down when judged according to international metrics  healthcare systems not doing so great wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially there was an implied promise to a generation of americans that if you do certain things work hard go to college be a good person you would have certain outcomes and those outcomes didnt materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decisionmaking positions lowered the capital gains tax  so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year in postworld war ii us leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for national security by making the us dollar the default international trade currency which gave america the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a us financial banking system but consequently increased the value of the us dollar astronomically which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in america  although the logic at the time  was that americans were supposed to upskill en masse away from the menial manufacturing jobs but everyone heres too much of a dumbass to stay school so we just traded domestic manufacturing to asia and the rest of the world at the expense of workingclass families but if you dont read enough  it comes out as lets go brandon  and its  you have a point but you dont have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didnt read enough you gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag theres a book behind the word you gotta keep going you can go at your own pace but you gotta finish the required reading otherwise we cant have a conversation were all catching up to each other im friends with maga im friends with the magas some of them are my good friends  whoo yeah hawaii maga  the friendliest of all maga  aloha maga theyre in hawaii right now making aloha great again i became friends with them because i filmed two seasons of a tv show in hawaii doogie

the loco moco  very passionate people my maga friends and i respect their passion to some extent i do theyre  i love america i would die for this country and i believe them i believe they love america and i believe they would die for this country which is very admirable but its  man you are willing to die for your country why arent you willing to learn math  also for your country   do both for your country i know you wanna die for your country but were losing the engineering jobs to asia right now so if you we need less people to die for their country we need more people to do their homework for their country  do your homework for your country  actually sit down and show the work and  do the thats a more efficient way to show your patriotism if you take that i want to die energy and you put it into homework you will fucking top the school im telling you its skys the limit  dude youll youll solve a lot of problems youll create a lot of jobs youll increase the gdp just do do your homework for your country id rather die  i i thought so i thought that might be i thought that might be the case dyings easy math is hard  these quadratic equations making me suicidal  we try not to talk about politics my maga friends and i out of mutual respect inevitably it comes up some stuff im wrong about some stuff theyre right about but sometimes  their messaging is so convoluted  i cant get to what their core issue actually is because their surface messaging is so chaotic  sometimes theyre  ronny china caused covid but covid isnt real  so is it fine then does it mean its fine i dont know how to feel about it now cause one minus one is zero i dont know what to tell you the the math analogy works for concepts not just numbers you can x is anything why are you yelling at me about china always

thats us  my my maga friends all hate us tax thats  a universal party platform theres different types of maga right theres  maga light maga concentrated but  right its unfair to group them under one banner but one uniting party principle is love america fuck us tax and i get it i also hate us tax now that im in the highest bracket  yeah im maga with that fuck us tax yeah fuck american tax feels good to say it  the words give you power right fuck us tax fuck american tax you  it you  it when i say it when this fucking foreigner says it you  that fuck us tax you  that you  it when this accent

consider this concept in a vacuum just as an academic exercise  when you love something you give it money  right  thats one of the primary ways we show love for individuals organizations ideas on

selfaccomplished she is im sure your mom could use it fix the driveway invest in infrastructure something  sometimes americans treat their country the way they treat their parents  yeah  i love my mom i love my mom i would die for my mom but fuck her she made her choices  i love being in america i do i love being here i had my options i came here i love being in america because this is the country

believing everything they see on the internet i get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last due to the exponential technology growth curve  but this has got to be the biggest gap in human history the information asymmetry right now is just out of control you literally have people in honolulu right now autodriving

cant give you this knowledge its  malcolm gladwells blink ive seen so much shit on the internet my brain instantly filters it youll never have this skill set so just stay off the internet this world is not for you anymore stop making decisions  but anyway respect your elders  its a confucian value maybe if you give your mom some money she wouldnt get scammed so much yeah well think about the correlation between those two phenomena  people always ask me  why do you shit on your mom for money why dont you shit on your dad for money    no i dont talk about my dad because  my dad has no context for show business  we grew up in malaysia  his families are rubber tappers in malaysia my aunts and uncles are still in sitiawan in malaysia right now tapping rubber they have no context for show business very smart people but they dont know this world my dad he was the first guy in his family to get a college education he went to manchester college which has merged with the university of southern new hampshire he got his masters of economics there put himself through it very smart guy and he was a good immigrant he came to america to new hampshire to get his education and when he graduated he went back to malaysia he didnt take anyones job he left  and my dad had the vision to see what i didnt see he knew he had a ceiling on him because of the way he thinks and talks and he went back to malaysia and he was right for him he went back it was the right choice for him he became a very successful corporate executive  he retired to a farm in johor bahru malaysia love farming he retired to a farm thats how much this guy loved it but he had no context for show business so he wouldnt understand anything im doing  he wouldnt understand what im doing in godzilla vs kong hed be  why dont you just run that way  dad i dont control the edit  im just honolulu chinatown shopkeeper no  in this in this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla  im just connecting act  to act  i dont have a say in how this plays out because of that i stopped telling him about what i was doing i felt he wouldnt get it and he stopped asking me so i didnt tell him i got hired on the daily show he found out the way all parents find out about their kids accolades through a local newspaper so one day the local paper reported that i got hired on the daily show and he called me immediately he was  ronny whats this i hear about you joining the everyday show and i was  oh no its the daily show i joined  two years ago dad he was  oh  well whats the daily show im  its just  another latenight american talk show they kind of invented modern american satire and  and  my dad was  oh thats cool are you the host im  no im a correspondent he was  what is that whats a correspondent im  yeah correspondent is i help the host with comedy segments and he was  oh  hey mei hes just a sidekick  and so he had  no context for what was a win what was a milestone in this industry and so i stopped telling him and he stopped asking me and i didnt need that from him we we were totally fine wed talk about other stuff not about work we werent fighting it was all good  and he passed away very suddenly  in  he died on christmas eve died on his farm  no warning no explanation he just left one day he left so suddenly we had to go back to handle his estate if anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position when you have to handle someone elses estate it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life and so its me my wife my sister brotherinlaw went back to johor bahru and part of me trying to figure out his estate was i had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using so his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it and i opened it up and its passwordprotected and i know this guy so well im  his password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child so  i type in my sisters birthday and spot on spot on it was my sisters birthday  as it should be shes  an anesthesiologist in australia shes  way more respectable person than me actually saving lives  a good person contributing back to society not  this fucking asshole i get in  i get in trouble on the internet for shit i said two years ago every six weeks so it should be her she should be the favorite so i log into his computer i open his web browser i look at his browsing history and the whole time im  please dont let me find my dads porn please dont let me find what positions my dad was into even if it was just missionary i wouldnt be able to handle it im gonna have to burn this laptop for real chinese people when we burn things it goes to our ancestors and then my granddad is gonna see it and its  i dont i dont want that for them ill be fine but theyre gonna have an awkward time im considerate  that  so i open the web browser look at his history and way to go dad no porn what a cleancut guy no porn he only went on the internet twice a day  clockwork  am and  pm  the farmer that he was and every time he went on the internet hed only go to two websites each time so the first website hed go to was a local news website and the second website hed go to twice a day every single day was my twitter page  aw so hed be reloading my twitter page twice a day just to see what i was doing and i post stuff  hey honolulu hawaii i sold out five shows  this week whys there so many homeless people here id post stuff  that  and  he would read that and then hed be  i assume hed be  oh ronnys doing  hes in hawaii he sold out some shows and oh i guess theres a lot of homeless people in hawaii  and  that was his quiet way of keeping up with me he never told me that and i never knew that and we never discussed it  which is a very nice sentiment unfortunately  as best as i can tell this is the last tweet my dad read of mine  so as best as i can tell forensically based on internet browsing timestamps the last tweet my dad read of mine and quite possibly the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm was me posting on twitter if youre a baby boomer on twitter i already know youre a fucking loser  now obviously this was not directed towards him i didnt even know he had twitter i didnt even know he knew what twitter was but i stand by the statement   and i know thats kind of a weird way to end the show but    if its any solace  this was his phone when he died  aw that was his  wallpaper and his screensaver and  and i didnt even know and its a photo of me and my wife and were in hawaii and im wearing two leis cause my mom threw one off and i put it on  and  i didnt know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper  and   i i  to i  to think that  that is the last image he saw of me thats what he remembered me by when he left and  i also would  to tell my sister i won  i won it was me it was me you guys have been great
