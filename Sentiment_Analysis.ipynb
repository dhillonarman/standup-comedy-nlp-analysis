thank you five people i appreciate that  i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat  shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through and then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its  to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find out  i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books  fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was  the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost   and everybody thought it was  this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was  the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was  you never know when you might need this and i was  but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success i grew up a lot this past year  this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and  hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was  oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was  oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was  all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had  we had we had so much chemistry he was  hey wassup i was  wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was  hey can you drop me off i was  where he was  at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was  oh no i just fucked a homeless dude again my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who   wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they  to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it  because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude  you feel  youre in a wes anderson movie or something and  white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff  voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff  that and its very  its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel  im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement  just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im  i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer  but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you  you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on  my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was  hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its  making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just  a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night  oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre  i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more  loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell  responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding  between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things  host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse   learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up  filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was  its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was  its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total  private school asians we both are big hippies too we  to backpack through southeast asia we  to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit  that  we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes  freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats  a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel  we are white people doing an impression of asian people  we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were  oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so  i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because  that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre  im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is  shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always  oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013  you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and  very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be  were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be  we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre  but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do  how much shittier food tastes when  you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be  look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im  that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retired i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day  youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically  wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre  oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks  its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to  squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want  its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was  you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently  and he was  hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was  why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes  mrs pacman just lets redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was   youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really  freaked out about anal and theyre  oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel  youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt  i got a second chance at life  i was  oh my god its  im going back in time \\u266a a whole new world \\u266a it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah  a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your\\u2013 just give your man a little\\u2013 a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari  and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont\\u2013 no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they  it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i  that fear that shit turns me on  especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye  hes discovered nirvana and its  youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim  my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when\\u2013 when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right  i respect you right im  yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who  to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their\\u2013 glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control   i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live  i just wanna be out of control for once just\\u2013 just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cunt im just waiting for the right moment to  become a housewife financially  i want my husband to get us to  a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people thats the kind of income bracket im striving for thats when  youve made it when youre eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple  what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking  a princess i have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be  guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are  thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me  a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were  ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was  yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won  another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were  why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was  yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed  a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and  why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were  yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im  oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here  i need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre  im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are  the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because  im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me  im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbusters i dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b  skittles so my uterus probably looked  a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act  everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich  mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were  oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was  only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be  were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its  release the kraken and they just come out  a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship  and  yeah and most of the time  we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be  ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look  they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be  hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymore im very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre  oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was   yeah where im from thats  losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was  no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was  yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was  you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted im scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula  what that is  what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did  that youre gonna poop on the table i was  yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense  that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channel i can already see how theres  this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommy  i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i  i berate my husband on  a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant  your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see  a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then  they get big\\u2013 they get big  fingers  you you you owe me money you my nipples look  whoppers now and naked i look  a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not  when i was  years old when it was  really hot  and i was  why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporin so  i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos  way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and  two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnant all right ive been ali wong have a good night everybody thank you your email address will not

it but i  it i  making hitler jokes its cool for me i enjoy it hell i lost my grandfather i lost my grandfather in the holocaust museum it was the holocaust museum of modern art which is just  a normal holocaust museum except you walk around all day being  oh i should have thought of that my grandmother died about a year ago and i didnt think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away but i was wrong it was fine the hard part the upsetting part was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted she wanted to die in the best way possible   you radio winner whats the best way you can die this is not a trick question \\u2013 in your sleep \\u2013 yes thank you thank you everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep not me i want to be alert awake surrounded by friends in a house fire but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep we thought thats how she went we were all excited for her but then we did an autopsy found out she actually died horribly in the worst way possible during an autopsy it was fucked up yeah yeah she always said her grandkids didnt pay enough attention to her and and she was right she was dead on but i loved my grandma loved her very much my grandma taught me about a lot taught me what religion is taught me everything you can know about religion in one quick story ill tell you now when i graduated from high school when i graduated my grandma came to me gave me a big hug said anthony im so proud of you youre my first grandchild to get to go to college what can i do for you what can i give you before you go to college and i said honestly grandma all i need from you is money yeah i know you guys have never been but college is expensive and my grandma said  anthony i understand couple months go by its the end of summer im packing up my dads car getting ready to go to school and my grandma walks up says anthony here before you leave take this and she handed me a brandnew bible king james version and i said thanks grandma thats exactly what we talked about i got in the car and i went off to school couple of weeks go by im hanging out in my dorm room having a good time when the phone rings its my grandma anthony just calling to see how college is going grandma college is the best im having the time of my life but to be honest im starting to run low on money and i could use a little bit  we talked about she said  well let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said totally grandma im on chapter four she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later hung up the phone couple of months go by now im really starting to struggle financially might have to drop out of school so i call my grandma in a panic i say please its anthony im having the time of my life in college but if i wanna graduate and i do i need you to send me some money  we talked about she said anthony let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said yes grandma i wish it was longer and she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later finally its the end of the school year ive got straight as but im dropping out of college cause i have no more money left and im furious close to tears cleaning out my dorm room when the phone rings its my grandma anthony i heard youre dropping out of school today how come and i said  goddamn well how come grandma cause you wouldnt give me any money she said anthony let me ask you this did you read your bible and i just hung up the phone i was so pissed off took everything out of that room last thing i took off the shelf the last thing i took out of that room was that bible my grandma had given me took it off the shelf held it in my hands and for the first time i actually opened it up and on the very first page in my grandmothers handwriting it said fuck you thank you everyone i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight and all the jokes i write theyre all made up theyre all fake except for eric clapton and the challenger everything else everything else is fake but everything im about to tell you from here until the end of the show thats all true now i dont tell dark jokes because im a comedian im a comedian because i tell dark jokes im kind of fucked up all right ive always been this way i cant really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends its ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyones funeral i asked a friend for advice was  ive never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and dont tell a joke try not to so i walked up and was   what my favorite memory was when i was  four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it  mark twain out of my grandmas mouth it would just come to life and then i couldnt help myself i said and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the n word now i promise you i promise you until youve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wifes funeral at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think im one of the best comedians of all time but heres the thing it doesnt matter if you believe me it really doesnt matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i  to test myself i  to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i  to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i dont believe in too soon im on a tight schedule and im good at it im good at it  the day of the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted other than that how was the movie right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that the reason i get away with stuff  that is im just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didnt make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i dont follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying dont do it and whenever i see that whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad cause i know something horrible has happened people will say anthony whats funny about aurora whats funny about the boston marathon whats funny about your grandmothers funeral nothing nothing is funny about those things thats where i come in so i see these texts and im  oh no what happened but i also think ive got a job to do so i go online i start reading about it i dont want to watch the footage but ill read about what happened and i think how can i make someone laugh today and then i think i got it i go back on twitter and i tweet guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed especially the finish line and again i think nailed it usa usa but then my phone starts to ring and its my boss or should i say my former boss and they say anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today youre also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or youre fired and i say go fuck yourselves and i meant it i didnt get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because im dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said sure they said well anthony you dont understand you dont understand at all if you dont take this joke down right now if you dont delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people theyre also out of a job and im ashamed to tell you this im embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke cause im happy to fight for what i believe in im happy to take the consequences for what ive done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet couldnt do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now ill tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in im just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture theyre  anthony were family why are you so upset cant you see we did you a favor dont you worry about your career let me ask you san francisco do i seem  i worry about my career no  why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if theyre worried about their money they wouldnt have played the lottery in the first fuckin place i do not worry about my career and they said anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems  youre making fun of the victims and thats wrong but thats not what im doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell me im wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking hey are we trending no this is who im making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston do  what thats worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying dont forget about me today dont forget about me lots of crazy distractions in the news but dont forget how sad i am those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of theyre  a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understand now im sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it its fine its embarrassing but its fun you can laugh at yourself its not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me thats fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess thats what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called shark party all right now some of you enjoyed it but if youve never seen shark party you can never see shark party its been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year  million sharks are killed by human beings every year   people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack im  fuck yeah win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say  what i want to have a shark party as soon as theres a shark attack were having a shark party and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do ive already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark its time for a shark party lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing ive ever said on television smile you son of a bitch shark party and in america where im famous for those types of

hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke ive made even better this man is fantastici watched the show  times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable  great material so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is  but a joke about a famous musicians son falling to his death isnt  where are your

ladies and gentlemen make some noise for ronny chieng     thank you thank you hawaii im turning  so im harvesting my wifes eggs this year im harvesting my wifes eggs so that we can make embryos so we can freeze the embryos so that we do not have to have kids right now because kids are what you have when youve given up on your own hopes and dreams  im still trying here i look at my friends who are my age who have kids and they all look  shit  its gotten to the point where i cant even take a photo with them and post it on my main grid because it messes up the aesthetics of my instagram too much with their fucking haggard faces just drooping wrinkly crowsfeetembedded heads receding hairlines just withering graying hair coming out in clumps because of their children  i did a show and someone i went to high school with in singapore came to the show and after the show i met up with them and they brought another person with them and i was  oh is this other person your mom thank you so much for bringing your mother to my show and that other person was also someone i went to high school with  thats how fucking ugly  these people have become because of their children just unrecognizable so im trying to use money and science to push the curve back a little bit and  first step of harvesting my wifes eggs is i have to inject my wife twice a day for two weeks so i have to inject my wife i am the one injecting my wife twice a day for two weeks zero medical training i was given no medical training whatsoever the government lets you do this the the doctor asked me to do it the doctor was  hey have you ever held a needle before no perfect here take this and inject your wife in the middle of her body  nicolas cage in the rock  twice a day for two weeks with chemicals that we mail to you mystery chemicals that we send to your house in unmarked brown boxes just trust us that its the right thing that youre injecting into the person you love the most internet chemicals that show up it comes in a powder i have to make it into a liquid you understand its a meth lab in my kitchen as im mixing the comp im sweating the whole time cause im scared ill fuck up the measurements and kill my wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely then you have to  the air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements and then you have to put it in the syringe then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude   what youre doing   i dont know what im doing i saw someone do this on doogie howser   i dont even know the angle to put it into her   it looks so painful going in  i love my wife so much i cant even bear to watch her in pain i couldnt even bear to watch the needle go into her i had to inject my wife  this i had to  cover my eyes and  backhand it  into her  kurosawa  did i get the middle of your body no  just walk into the needle  im supposed to do all the work here meet me halfway and  the doctor said if you do everything right if you measure correctly you inject at the right times they scan  this part of her body  that chicago bulls logo right and they were   if you do everything right based on what we can tell you should expect  eggs  and my wife ended up getting   yeah always a  yeah always  a late halfhearted response to  usually the women in the crowd are  whoo yeah all the men in the crowd are always   is that a good number is  a good number of eggs how many eggs equal one bebe is it four eggs is one bebe so  eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together let me put this in a language that men can understand  twentysix eggs from one vagina in one cycle is mvp numbers  twentysix eggs is  if magic johnson averaged the tripledouble and killed his own aids   thats the level of medical miracle thats happening in whatever this part of my wifes body that horn of the bull that  curls into itself the doctor  scraped out  eggs out of my wifes vagina  salmon roe just scooping out just dripping out and then you put it in some nigiri right and then you eat it thats how babies are made you gotta salt bae the eggs onto the ikura and then you eat it so  were trying to make embryos so eggs thats just half the equation i dont know if  how embryos are made but eggs thats just half of it she did her part admirably so now i have to contribute my half of the embryo equation so im sitting in the doctors office   a wet pigeon all right and the doctor comes over and the doctors a woman because of course she is shes  good morning mr chieng so  whens the last time you ejaculated my wife is right here and shes  yeah when is the last time you ejaculated  we would all  to know its the one time in life where youre not allowed to lie about jerking off its when a medical professional is asking you a direct question and its for reproduction its for the intended purpose so you gotta tell the truth so im  whatever ill tell the truth  let me check my calendar   i guess the last time i ejaculated was  let me see  yesterday around  pm  and my wife is  yesterday i was with you all day  and i was  yeah but remember when you took out the trash   because i also put up mvp numbers against a shot clock and heavy defensive pressure but i was thinking of you the whole time its really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever vietnamese people eat my wife is vietnamese ive no idea what the fuck she eats n\\u01b0\\u1edbc m\\u1eafm  and i went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off its the medical jerkingoff room every hospital has a medical jerkingoff room  its nondescript not a lot of signage smaller than i think it should be lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt and im sitting in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and theres grown men outside the door waiting for me to finish  so they too can use the medical jerkingoff room that we are sharing  a wework  and im in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and i couldnt go  sorry sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand im sorry sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me sorry sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters as they code to death painfully and the families crying in the waiting room wasnt turning me on  so i couldnt go i couldnt go so i just call  right im    im  these people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room  i call the doctor back in and im  doc i cant go  i cant medically ejaculate under these circumstances the vibes are off let me go home let me go home to medically ejaculate can i do that and the doctors  yeah you can go home but  as soon as it comes out of your body it expires quicker than avocados in hawaii  youve got  you have  a  window before theres  an exponential decreasing probability of  im   fine ill go home ill medically ejaculate ill come back in  minutes no problem so i go home open the front door ejaculate immediately  this is   this is home court advantage i know where everything is i know whats behind me i look at the dripping garbage bag  its  a pavlovian response at this point  i ejaculate into a cup  its a cup that they gave me its not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen  that says worlds best dad on it  its the cup that they use doctors give you to test your pee for drugs its got a really tight cap right so i ejaculate into the cup it keeps overflowing so i gotta keep  pouring it out  just overwhelming amounts  its  ghostbusters  up in here   i fill it to the brim and then i scrape off the top and then i and then i seal the cap as tight as i can right get it really nice and tight and then i i put it inside my tshirt next to my skin under my armpit nice and snug because the doctor told me to do that because apparently  the titanic your body heat will keep your people alive and then i run downstairs and i jump into a new york city taxi and im  take me to langone hospital please hurry up the taxi driver is  what the fuck are you doing with your hand are you  im  oh yeah no im fine no its not me its my my wife shes wait a person its my jizz  and new york city taxis have seen much worse so the taxi driver was  oh  cool thank you for using a cup  unlike the last two dudes who were back there just raw dogging at the jfk  what im saying and  we get to the we get to the hospital right i open the taxi door i run into the hospital and because its new york city someone on the sidewalk is  hey yo hey yo were you that guy in shangchi  am i yes i was a minor character in the marvel movie shangchi not the main guy and the guys  yo yo can i get a photo with you and im   sure  so we take a photo  this so someone on the internet has a photo of me and this stranger and im doing this  napoleon if you ever come across this photo just know i am holding my own jizz  so feel free to tag it  he was very grateful he was  aw thanks so much man and i was  no problem man i shake his hand right  because i love meeting my fans and i run into the hospital right already hitting the  mark end of the fourth quarter theres no time left on the clock so i just take my jizz and i just throw a buzzerbeater right the doctor  catches my jizz    odell beckham she just  one hand grabs it and  in the same motion without even putting it down she  alleyoops my jizz into my wifes eggs right just takes it and she goes boom shakalaka and  my sperm goes into my wifes eggs and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg nobody knows its a mystery its a mystery of the universe nobody knows when sperm goes into the egg its unknowable ooh its its  the event horizon on a black hole no one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes nothing happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes it becomes a bubble tea  nobody knows where bubble tea comes from its tapioca the sperm goes into the egg and then you shake it and you go to vegas you throw it on the crap table and if youre lucky if you get a good dice roll right it becomes a blastocyst thats what we call future humans blastocysts it becomes embryos the doctor shell take all the embryos and shell look at them under the microscope and shell grade the embryos  cocaine  shell be  ooh yeah these ones these are agrade embryos right here   these ones these are these are bgrade embryos so so i dont know  these these ones these are cgrade embryos  oh and these ones yeah these these are these are dgrade embryos yeah these these will storm the capitol someday  so  you dont want that and then  and then you have to  draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics and you dont know youre just projecting data you just hope youre not throwing away a tom brady in the  round thats going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you cant measure the human spirit and  we all  to think were good people in this room but were all picking the agrade embryos  no one here is not picking your agrade embryos if given a choice even if you were a bgrade embryo  you would still pick your agrade embryos because youll be  i know what its  im not putting my kids through this bgrade human existence with sweaty palms and sciatica  give me the agrade shit give me the best we could do give my kid a fighting chance and it got me thinking about the future a little bit because i never wanted kids i never thought i would have kids the only thing i ever wanted to do my whole life was this standup comedy in america  its the best look at this its the best you are cheering because  this is way better than having kids   so much more fun and lucrative well the blastocysts are real now theres eight of them waiting for me in the cloud   chance of successful implantation with gradea embryos so i guess that makes me a mass murderer in alabama it got me thinking about the future what kind of parent am i gonna be am i gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were or am i gonna be better than my parents were be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck youre supposed to be now and thinking about it turns out im gonna be just as bad as my parents were i can i can feel it i can feel it inside me i can feel the i can feel the chinese inside me i can just feel that high expectation just low tolerance for excuses its in here its right in here its  the default app  you cant delete the calculator app theres no x when you shake it theres no x you can move it off the home screen but its still in the os embedded  in the operating system i can feel the chinese if my blastocyst was real if it entered this reality and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever oh my god look at this blastocyst everybody look look at how beautiful this blastocyst is i love you so much blastocyst i love you much more than i thought i would  and your blastocyst is hugging you back right theyre   i love you too daddy daddy daddy when i grow up i want to be a standup comedian just  you  i just feel the chinese coming on right i just  you take your glasses off  hitler in the bunker  standup comedy are you out of your fucking mind  thats not even a real job what do you think is gonna happen just gonna run around america and tell jokes to strangers who dont give a fuck about your mental health and even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds and make it to even a semiprofessional level as a standup comedian do you think theres any chance in hell youll be funnier than me    dad is a borderline arena act in some markets have you seen my imdb page im in everything i will fucking crush your career osoto gari your mother and i just spent a fortune to make an agrade blastocyst for them to become a bgrade comedian i will never watch anything you do go to law school   is what my father said to me  i do think its tough for straight men in  to sincerely look up selfimprovement on the internet without five weeks later storming the capitol  that mens selfhelp youtube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now  im not saying its the biggest problem in the world clearly but it is a problem  because men were genetically predisposed to seek selfimprovement  were trying to be better people every day believe it or not women  once we hit a certain age  usually we die before then through suicide or environmental factors bmx biking dietary choices but if you can live long enough as a man you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective  you start seeking guidance from outside sources you start looking at watches   every man in this room has or will at some point weve all been there guys weve all done this weve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives and weve been  what a fucking piece of shit  i fucking hate this loser look at this loser fuck this loser i hate this person i need to be a better person let me start by getting fit   let me work on my health that seems  a logical place to start my journey let me control what i can control in here so what do you do as a man you go on youtube right you look up how to lift weights right you press enter you click on the first video its some guy doing kettlebell swings right hell teach you how to lock your core so you dont break your fucking spine and then you do that for two days you feel pretty good about yourself  whoo right and on the third day the same youtube channel has a new video notification alert the men are  whats this new video from kettlebellswinging guy what could he be doing in his new video in the video the kettlebellswinging guy hes doing the new kettlebell exercise the lawnmower hes doing that and then   seconds into the video he just suddenly just stops and he looks really sad and he puts the kettlebell down and he looks straight into the camera and hes  yo guys just real talk for a second all right  kettlebells are great but i just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind  and all the men watching this are  yeah  yeah that makes sense that feels right in here tell me more kettlebellswinging guy  what other advice do you have for all areas of my life including my relationships and financial investments please give me guidance kettlebellswinging guy so what do you do you watch his next video on autoplay then you watch his next video here comes the youtube algorithm with a suggested video and here comes another suggested video and a week later jordan peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men  five weeks later youre storming the capitol dressed  a buffalo    thats a very realistic sequence of events by the way thats not even an exaggerated timeline every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm we all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that mens selfhelp andrew tate masculinity youtube selfhelp algorithm if you dont know anyone who lost their mind  youre the one who lost their mind youre currently in an echo chamber of assholes cause real friends tell you when youre losing your mind its very tragic all these men who are trying to be better people and theyre seeking guidance but that youtube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves theres tragedy in that  all those people they were just trying to lift weights  they werent trying to cause an insurrection they didnt even know what that word meant they were just trying to do this theyre trying to do this they didnt know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis\\u00e0vis their torso right is it  degrees or  degrees  is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you they googled it one time and then five weeks later youre taking a shit on nancy pelosis desk  and the us marshals are garnishing your wages because you take one wrong turn and life moves pretty quick im not saying as a man dont take responsibility for your own actions  im just saying that youtube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys it it sucks men in in a way that i dont think women understand it really preys on that mens need to seek guidance from somewhere its very hard to resist it just draws draws you in thats why fucking mark zuckerberg is trying to mma fight elon musk right now  that guy fell for his own algorithm do you understand mark zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd and for   years now hes just been looking at our data right jerking off every single day just looking at our data jerking off money piling up billions of dollars data jerking off money money jerking off data for  years that loop and who knew after two decades of that one day he just looked at so much data he was  oh shit oh shit he fell into it now hes trying to mmafight elon musk that guy jerked off and came on his own face   its out of control zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality and he invented that shit and he still fell for it what hope does the average man in america have just walking just waddling down the street looking looking for a taco on his phone hes gonna get sucked into his phone he has no chance that fucking guy has no chance because even the good guys in this room were all  on a razors edge to being a piece of shit   that margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razorthin i gotta tell you if you have the means every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge and  what an instagram post could push it either way   it depends on the post was it cute animals or was it boobs  thats gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours i do think as a society we need to  do a better job of identifying  when we have a disagreement with someone whos genuinely trying to have a goodfaith discussion to reach higher understanding and whos just talking shit we are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit and were not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics  for example me right now im just talking shit   this is oneway shittalking i dont care about any of your opinions do not send me any of them i do not care you paid for me i didnt pay a cent for any of you    free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shittalking session if you dont  it take it out on adam smith but if i was having a conversation with someone i disagree with in good faith i would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with thatd be a logical place to start a difficult conversation for example maga make america great again they have a point americas not doing so great right now right our kids math scores are down  our childrens science scores are down when judged according to international metrics  healthcare systems not doing so great wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially there was an implied promise to a generation of americans that if you do certain things work hard go to college be a good person you would have certain outcomes and those outcomes didnt materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decisionmaking positions lowered the capital gains tax  so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year in postworld war ii us leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for national security by making the us dollar the default international trade currency which gave america the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a us financial banking system but consequently increased the value of the us dollar astronomically which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in america  although the logic at the time  was that americans were supposed to upskill en masse away from the menial manufacturing jobs but everyone heres too much of a dumbass to stay school so we just traded domestic manufacturing to asia and the rest of the world at the expense of workingclass families but if you dont read enough  it comes out as lets go brandon  and its  you have a point but you dont have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didnt read enough you gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag theres a book behind the word you gotta keep going you can go at your own pace but you gotta finish the required reading otherwise we cant have a conversation were all catching up to each other im friends with maga im friends with the magas some of them are my good friends  whoo yeah hawaii maga  the friendliest of all maga  aloha maga theyre in hawaii right now making aloha great again i became friends with them because i filmed two seasons of a tv show in hawaii doogie

over so gracious you show up theyre so warm and welcoming thanks for coming take whatever you want theres some kalua pork theres some loco mocos hot dogs hey here here touch my gun  touch it just touch just take it im always  i i dont want to touch any of these guns  i dont know where theyve been i dont know where theyre going i dont have time in my schedule to attend depositions  just give me the loco moco  very passionate people my maga friends and i respect their passion to some extent i do theyre  i love america i would die for this country and i believe them i believe they love america and i believe they would die for this country which is very admirable but its  man you are willing to die for your country why arent you willing to learn math  also for your country   do both for your country i know you wanna die for your country but were losing the engineering jobs to asia right now so if you we need less people to die for their country we need more people to do their homework for their country  do your homework for your country  actually sit down and show the work and  do the thats a more efficient way to show your patriotism if you take that i want to die energy and you put it into homework you will fucking top the school im telling you its skys the limit  dude youll youll solve a lot of problems youll create a lot of jobs youll increase the gdp just do do your homework for your country id rather die  i i thought so i thought that might be i thought that might be the case dyings easy math is hard  these quadratic equations making me suicidal  we try not to talk about politics my maga friends and i out of mutual respect inevitably it comes up some stuff im wrong about some stuff theyre right about but sometimes  their messaging is so convoluted  i cant get to what their core issue actually is because their surface messaging is so chaotic  sometimes theyre  ronny china caused covid but covid isnt real  so is it fine then does it mean its fine i dont know how to feel about it now cause one minus one is zero i dont know what to tell you the the math analogy works for concepts not just numbers you can x is anything why are you yelling at me about china always yelling at me about china china is doing this china did a weather balloon with a camera chinas got an artificial island in the pacific doubling as an aircraft carrier base chinas doing tiktok why is

thats us  my my maga friends all hate us tax thats  a universal party platform theres different types of maga right theres  maga light maga concentrated but  right its unfair to group them under one banner but one uniting party principle is love america fuck us tax and i get it i also hate us tax now that im in the highest bracket  yeah im maga with that fuck us tax yeah fuck american tax feels good to say it  the words give you power right fuck us tax fuck american tax you  it you  it when i say it when this fucking foreigner says it you  that fuck us tax you  that you  it when this accent

consider this concept in a vacuum just as an academic exercise  when you love something you give it money  right  thats one of the primary ways we show love for individuals organizations ideas on kickstarter sports teams we go  yeah we give it money so when you go love america usa usa fuck us tax so what are you saying you love america so much you want it to be poor you want your country to be

every once in a while probably tore stuff giving birth to you cut her a piece of the pie arbitrarily even just give a im sure your mother would appreciate it no matter who your mom is how selfaccomplished she is im sure your mom could use it fix the driveway invest in infrastructure something  sometimes americans treat their country the way they treat their parents  yeah  i love my mom i love my mom i would die for my mom but fuck her she made her choices  i love being in america i do i love being here i had my options i came here i love being in america because this is the country that puts show business above everything and i am in the business of show business so naturally im gonna come here and do it i do this in america fuck america fuck the president fuck us tax money money just comes into  fuck the president hes too old fuck this president the money comes in money just comes in  printing money i do this in malaysia same same words same same clothing same haircut facing the same direction in malaysia jail   the arbitrage value is out of control same product in different loc obviously ill do this here why the fuck would i do it anywhere else its the best i

disrespectful and they forget  im also an immigrant theyll be   my parents theyre immigrants  immigrants theyre so cheap   dont come over my familys over this weekend my parents are here my parents

believing everything they see on the internet i get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last due to the exponential technology growth curve  but this has got to be the biggest gap in human history the information asymmetry right now is just out of control you literally have people in honolulu right now autodriving their tesla cybertrucks as they vape out the window and their phone ai is trading cryptocurrency meanwhile you have baby boomers they cant even rightclick  they cant even rightclick theres one button

how did  that because the font the font is off and the resolution of the image is blurry and that lighting state doesnt make sense for that image and thats not standard dimensions for a news article i cant give you this knowledge its  malcolm gladwells blink ive seen so much shit on the internet my brain instantly filters it youll never have this skill set so just stay off the internet this world is not for you anymore stop making decisions  but anyway respect your elders  its a confucian value maybe if you give your mom some money she wouldnt get scammed so much yeah well think about the correlation between those two phenomena  people always ask me  why do you shit on your mom for money why dont you shit on your dad for money    no i dont talk about my dad because  my dad has no context for show business  we grew up in malaysia  his families are rubber tappers in malaysia my aunts and uncles are still in sitiawan in malaysia right now tapping rubber they have no context for show business very smart people but they dont know this world my dad he was the first guy in his family to get a college education he went to manchester college which has merged with the university of southern new hampshire he got his masters of economics there put himself through it very smart guy and he was a good immigrant he came to america to new hampshire to get his education and when he graduated he went back to malaysia he didnt take anyones job he left  and my dad had the vision to see what i didnt see he knew he had a ceiling on him because of the way he thinks and talks and he went back to malaysia and he was right for him he went back it was the right choice for him he became a very successful corporate executive  he retired to a farm in johor bahru malaysia love farming he retired to a farm thats how much this guy loved it but he had no context for show business so he wouldnt understand anything im doing  he wouldnt understand what im doing in godzilla vs kong hed be  why dont you just run that way  dad i dont control the edit  im just honolulu chinatown shopkeeper no  in this in this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla  im just connecting act  to act  i dont have a say in how this plays out because of that i stopped telling him about what i was doing i felt he wouldnt get it and he stopped asking me so i didnt tell him i got hired on the daily show he found out the way all parents find out about their kids accolades through a local newspaper so one day the local paper reported that i got hired on the daily show and he called me immediately he was  ronny whats this i hear about you joining the everyday show and i was  oh no its the daily show i joined  two years ago dad he was  oh  well whats the daily show im  its just  another latenight american talk show they kind of invented modern american satire and  and  my dad was  oh thats cool are you the host im  no im a correspondent he was  what is that whats a correspondent im  yeah correspondent is i help the host with comedy segments and he was  oh  hey mei hes just a sidekick  and so he had  no context for what was a win what was a milestone in this industry and so i stopped telling him and he stopped asking me and i didnt need that from him we we were totally fine wed talk about other stuff not about work we werent fighting it was all good  and he passed away very suddenly  in  he died on christmas eve died on his farm  no warning no explanation he just left one day he left so suddenly we had to go back to handle his estate if anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position when you have to handle someone elses estate it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life and so its me my wife my sister brotherinlaw went back to johor bahru and part of me trying to figure out his estate was i had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using so his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it and i opened it up and its passwordprotected and i know this guy so well im  his password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child so  i type in my sisters birthday and spot on spot on it was my sisters birthday  as it should be shes  an anesthesiologist in australia shes  way more respectable person than me actually saving lives  a good person contributing back to society not  this fucking asshole i get in  i get in trouble on the internet for shit i said two years ago every six weeks so it should be her she should be the favorite so i log into his computer i open his web browser i look at his browsing history and the whole time im  please dont let me find my dads porn please dont let me find what positions my dad was into even if it was just missionary i wouldnt be able to handle it im gonna have to burn this laptop for real chinese people when we burn things it goes to our ancestors and then my granddad is gonna see it and its  i dont i dont want that for them ill be fine but theyre gonna have an awkward time im considerate  that  so i open the web browser look at his history and way to go dad no porn what a cleancut guy no porn he only went on the internet twice a day  clockwork  am and  pm  the farmer that he was and every time he went on the internet hed only go to two websites each time so the first website hed go to was a local news website and the second website hed go to twice a day every single day was my twitter page  aw so hed be reloading my twitter page twice a day just to see what i was doing and i post stuff  hey honolulu hawaii i sold out five shows  this week whys there so many homeless people here id post stuff  that  and  he would read that and then hed be  i assume hed be  oh ronnys doing  hes in hawaii he sold out some shows and oh i guess theres a lot of homeless people in hawaii  and  that was his quiet way of keeping up with me he never told me that and i never knew that and we never discussed it  which is a very nice sentiment unfortunately  as best as i can tell this is the last tweet my dad read of mine  so as best as i can tell forensically based on internet browsing timestamps the last tweet my dad read of mine and quite possibly the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm was me posting on twitter if youre a baby boomer on twitter i already know youre a fucking loser  now obviously this was not directed towards him i didnt even know he had twitter i didnt even know he knew what twitter was but i stand by the statement   and i know thats kind of a weird way to end the show but    if its any solace  this was his phone when he died  aw that was his  wallpaper and his screensaver and  and i didnt even know and its a photo of me and my wife and were in hawaii and im wearing two leis cause my mom threw one off and i put it on  and  i didnt know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper  and   i i  to i  to think that  that is the last image he saw of me thats what he remembered me by when he left and  i also would  to tell my sister i won  i won it was me it was me you guys have been great

to get this shit over with cause i have to pee in  ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for coming  its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that  i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat  shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through and then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its  to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find out  i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books  fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was  the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost   and everybody thought it was  this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was  the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was  you never know when you might need this and i was  but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success i grew up a lot this past year  this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and  hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was  oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was  oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was  all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had  we had we had so much chemistry he was  hey wassup i was  wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was  hey can you drop me off i was  where he was  at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was  oh no i just fucked a homeless dude again my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who   wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they  to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it  because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude  you feel  youre in a wes anderson movie or something and  white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff  voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff  that and its very  its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel  im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement  just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im  i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer  but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you  you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on  my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was  hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its  making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just  a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night  oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre  i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more  loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell  responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding  between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things  host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse   learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up  filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was  its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was  its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total  private school asians we both are big hippies too we  to backpack through southeast asia we  to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit  that  we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes  freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats  a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel  we are white people doing an impression of asian people  we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were  oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so  i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because  that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre  im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is  shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always  oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013  you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and  very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be  were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be  we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre  but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do  how much shittier food tastes when  you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be  look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im  that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retired i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day  youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically  wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre  oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks  its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to  squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want  its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was  you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently  and he was  hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was  why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes  mrs pacman just lets redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was   youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really  freaked out about anal and theyre  oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel  youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt  i got a second chance at life  i was  oh my god its  im going back in time \\u266a a whole new world \\u266a it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah  a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your\\u2013 just give your man a little\\u2013 a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari  and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont\\u2013 no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they  it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i  that fear that shit turns me on  especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye  hes discovered nirvana and its  youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim  my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when\\u2013 when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right  i respect you right im  yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who  to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their\\u2013 glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control   i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live  i just wanna be out of control for once just\\u2013 just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cunt im just waiting for the right moment to  become a housewife financially  i want my husband to get us to  a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people thats the kind of income bracket im striving for thats when  youve made it when youre eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple  what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking  a princess i have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be  guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are  thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me  a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were  ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was  yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won  another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were  why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was  yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed  a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and  why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were  yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im  oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here  i need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre  im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are  the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because  im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me  im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbusters i dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b  skittles so my uterus probably looked  a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act  everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich  mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were  oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was  only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be  were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its  release the kraken and they just come out  a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship  and  yeah and most of the time  we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be  ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look  they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be  hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymore im very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre  oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was   yeah where im from thats  losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was  no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was  yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was  you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted im scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula  what that is  what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did  that youre gonna poop on the table i was  yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense  that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channel i can already see how theres  this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommy  i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i  i berate my husband on  a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant  your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see  a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then  they get big\\u2013 they get big  fingers  you you you owe me money you my nipples look  whoppers now and naked i look  a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not  when i was  years old when it was  really hot  and i was  why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporin so  i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos  way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and  two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnant all right ive been ali wong have a good night everybody thank you your email address will not

out a lot about yourselves on this next one hey did you guys know did you guys know that when a newborn baby when a newborn baby is first born when its fresh out of the womb it can actually hear and see everything around it for up to ten seconds after its decapitated yeah yeah i never know what to say i never know what to say to someone after theyve lost a baby what do you say to someone after theyve lost a baby oh im sorry for your loss doesnt cut it are you gonna be  not even close thats why i just keep my mouth shut let my lawyer do the talking im not good with kids thats my point thats what this whole things about im not good with kids not gonna lie hell a couple of months ago i dropped my cousins baby flatout dropped my cousins baby on the ground but i dont feel  that was my fault i dont feel responsible for that one  who in their right mind who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me anthony jeselnik to be a pallbearer its  people hate people hate dead baby jokes they hate them they hate them its  anthony why do you have to tell dead baby jokes why do you have so many dead baby jokes no one likes them why do you insist well ill tell you why because dead baby jokes have made me rich and who was it who was it who said the first million is the hardest was it hitler didnt see that one coming did you that was a good response most audiences just pretend i didnt say it but i  it i  making hitler jokes its cool for me i enjoy it hell i lost my grandfather i lost my grandfather in the holocaust museum it was the holocaust museum of modern art which is just  a normal holocaust museum except you walk around all day being  oh i should have thought of that my grandmother died about a year ago and i didnt think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away but i was wrong it was fine the hard part the upsetting part was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted she wanted to die in the best way possible   you radio winner whats the best way you can die this is not a trick question \\u2013 in your sleep \\u2013 yes thank you thank you everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep not me i want to be alert awake surrounded by friends in a house fire but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep we thought thats how she went we were all excited for her but then we did an autopsy found out she actually died horribly in the worst way possible during an autopsy it was fucked up yeah yeah she always said her grandkids didnt pay enough attention to her and and she was right she was dead on but i loved my grandma loved her very much my grandma taught me about a lot taught me what religion is taught me everything you can know about religion in one quick story ill tell you now when i graduated from high school when i graduated my grandma came to me gave me a big hug said anthony im so proud of you youre my first grandchild to get to go to college what can i do for you what can i give you before you go to college and i said honestly grandma all i need from you is money yeah i know you guys have never been but college is expensive and my grandma said  anthony i understand couple months go by its the end of summer im packing up my dads car getting ready to go to school and my grandma walks up says anthony here before you leave take this and she handed me a brandnew bible king james version and i said thanks grandma thats exactly what we talked about i got in the car and i went off to school couple of weeks go by im hanging out in my dorm room having a good time when the phone rings its my grandma anthony just calling to see how college is going grandma college is the best im having the time of my life but to be honest im starting to run low on money and i could use a little bit  we talked about she said  well let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said totally grandma im on chapter four she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later hung up the phone couple of months go by now im really starting to struggle financially might have to drop out of school so i call my grandma in a panic i say please its anthony im having the time of my life in college but if i wanna graduate and i do i need you to send me some money  we talked about she said anthony let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said yes grandma i wish it was longer and she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later finally its the end of the school year ive got straight as but im dropping out of college cause i have no more money left and im furious close to tears cleaning out my dorm room when the phone rings its my grandma anthony i heard youre dropping out of school today how come and i said  goddamn well how come grandma cause you wouldnt give me any money she said anthony let me ask you this did you read your bible and i just hung up the phone i was so pissed off took everything out of that room last thing i took off the shelf the last thing i took out of that room was that bible my grandma had given me took it off the shelf held it in my hands and for the first time i actually opened it up and on the very first page in my grandmothers handwriting it said fuck you thank you everyone i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight and all the jokes i write theyre all made up theyre all fake except for eric clapton and the challenger everything else everything else is fake but everything im about to tell you from here until the end of the show thats all true now i dont tell dark jokes because im a comedian im a comedian because i tell dark jokes im kind of fucked up all right ive always been this way i cant really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends its ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyones funeral i asked a friend for advice was  ive never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and dont tell a joke try not to so i walked up and was   what my favorite memory was when i was  four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it  mark twain out of my grandmas mouth it would just come to life and then i couldnt help myself i said and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the n word now i promise you i promise you until youve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wifes funeral at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think im one of the best comedians of all time but heres the thing it doesnt matter if you believe me it really doesnt matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i  to test myself i  to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i  to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i dont believe in too soon im on a tight schedule and im good at it im good at it  the day of the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted other than that how was the movie right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that the reason i get away with stuff  that is im just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didnt make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i dont follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying dont do it and whenever i see that whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad cause i know something horrible has happened people will say anthony whats funny about aurora whats funny about the boston marathon whats funny about your grandmothers funeral nothing nothing is funny about those things thats where i come in so i see these texts and im  oh no what happened but i also think ive got a job to do so i go online i start reading about it i dont want to watch the footage but ill read about what happened and i think how can i make someone laugh today and then i think i got it i go back on twitter and i tweet guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed especially the finish line and again i think nailed it usa usa but then my phone starts to ring and its my boss or should i say my former boss and they say anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today youre also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or youre fired and i say go fuck yourselves and i meant it i didnt get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because im dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said sure they said well anthony you dont understand you dont understand at all if you dont take this joke down right now if you dont delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people theyre also out of a job and im ashamed to tell you this im embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke cause im happy to fight for what i believe in im happy to take the consequences for what ive done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet couldnt do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now ill tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in im just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture theyre  anthony were family why are you so upset cant you see we did you a favor dont you worry about your career let me ask you san francisco do i seem  i worry about my career no  why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if theyre worried about their money they wouldnt have played the lottery in the first fuckin place i do not worry about my career and they said anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems  youre making fun of the victims and thats wrong but thats not what im doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell me im wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking hey are we trending no this is who im making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston do  what thats worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying dont forget about me today dont forget about me lots of crazy distractions in the news but dont forget how sad i am those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of theyre  a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understand now im sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it its fine its embarrassing but its fun you can laugh at yourself its not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me thats fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess thats what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called shark party all right now some of you enjoyed it but if youve never seen shark party you can never see shark party its been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year  million sharks are killed by human beings every year   people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack im  fuck yeah win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say  what i want to have a shark party as soon as theres a shark attack were having a shark party and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do ive already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark its time for a shark party lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing ive ever said on television smile you son of a bitch shark party and in america where im famous for those types of shenanigans everybody was  anthony that was fucked up it was fucked up to see you dance end of controversy however in new zealand where they dont get my show theyve never seen me and frankly they dont get out much the new zealand media takes the video and they show it to the guys family and they say what do you guys think about this and they say crikey or whatever the fuck they say over there the point is all of new zealand all of new zealand rises up against me all  of those cunts rise up and start threatening my life now i dont read the things that people write about me on the internet but i pay people who do and they come to me and theyre  weve got some terrible news please sit down they say you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of shark party and i was  really new zealand wants to kill me thats weird because they didnt even kill the shark i said how many death threats am i getting and they were  oh all of them you are getting all of the death threats what do you want us to do we can send someone to talk to them extra security what do you want i said no forget about it leave it alone dont worry this might be hard for some to understand ive said it several times tonight everyone is going to die i know full well i am going to die and most of us dont get to choose how we check out but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes best case scenario if somebody murders me over one of my jokes i immediately become a legend im a comedy god the mount rushmore of comedy is me four times i said come on then my security guys are   anthony well just so  that is the dumbest thing weve ever heard but youre the boss  and they leave and then the next day they come back and they say anthony sorry to bother you again i know you didnt care yesterday but its gotten much worse youre gonna wanna hear this they say someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dads phone number and address in pittsburgh posted that online and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand and i have to admit that had never occurred to me before it never crossed my mind that my family my loved ones would ever pay the price be caught in harms way for something ive done or ive joked about and honestly i would cut my throat for my jokes i would give my life for what i do but if anyone and i mean this for a fact if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke ive made even better this man is fantastici watched the show  times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable  great material so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is  but a joke about a famous musicians son falling to his death isnt  where are your

with their fucking haggard faces just drooping wrinkly crowsfeetembedded heads receding hairlines just withering graying hair coming out in clumps because of their children  i did a show and someone i went to high school with in singapore came to the show and after the show i met up with them and they brought another person with them and i was  oh is this other person your mom thank you so much for

wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely then you have to  the air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements and then you have to put it in the syringe then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude   what youre doing   i dont know what im doing i saw someone do this on doogie howser   i dont even know the angle to put

cover my eyes and  backhand it  into her  kurosawa  did i get the middle of your body no  just walk into the needle  im supposed to do all the work here meet me halfway and  the doctor said if you do everything right if you measure correctly you inject at the right times they scan  this part of her body  that chicago bulls logo right and they were   if you do everything right based on what we can tell you should expect  eggs  and my wife ended up getting   yeah always a  yeah always  a late halfhearted response to  usually the women in the crowd are  whoo yeah all the men in the crowd are always   is that a good number is  a good number of eggs how many eggs equal one bebe is it four eggs is one bebe so  eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together let me put this in a language that men can understand  twentysix eggs from one vagina in one cycle is mvp numbers  twentysix eggs is  if magic johnson averaged the tripledouble and killed his own aids   thats the level of medical miracle thats happening in whatever this part of my wifes body that horn of the bull that  curls into itself the doctor  scraped out  eggs out of my wifes vagina  salmon roe just scooping out just dripping out and then you put it in some nigiri right and then you eat it thats how babies are made you gotta salt bae the eggs onto the ikura and then you eat it so  were trying to make embryos so eggs thats just half the equation i dont know if  how embryos are made but eggs thats just half of it she did her part admirably so now i have to contribute my half of the embryo equation so im sitting in the doctors office   a wet pigeon all right and the doctor comes over and the doctors a woman because of course she is shes  good morning mr chieng so  whens the last time you ejaculated my wife is right here and shes  yeah when is the last time you ejaculated  we would all  to know its the one time in life where youre not allowed to lie about jerking off its when a medical professional is asking you a direct question and its for reproduction its for the intended purpose so you gotta tell the truth so im  whatever ill tell the truth  let me check my calendar   i guess the last time i ejaculated was  let me see  yesterday around  pm  and my wife is  yesterday i was with you all day  and i was  yeah but remember when you took out the trash   because i also put up mvp numbers against a shot clock and heavy defensive pressure but i was thinking of you the whole time its really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever vietnamese people eat my wife is vietnamese ive no idea what the fuck she eats n\\u01b0\\u1edbc m\\u1eafm  and i went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off its the medical jerkingoff room every hospital has a medical jerkingoff room  its nondescript not a lot of signage smaller than i think it should be lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt and im sitting in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and theres grown men outside the door waiting for me to finish  so they too can use the medical jerkingoff room that we are sharing  a wework  and im in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and i couldnt go  sorry sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand im sorry sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me sorry sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters as they code to death painfully and the families crying in the waiting room wasnt turning me on  so i couldnt go i couldnt go so i just call  right im    im  these people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room  i call the doctor back in and im  doc i cant go  i cant medically ejaculate under these circumstances the vibes are off let me go home let me go home to medically ejaculate can i do that and the doctors  yeah you can go home but  as soon as it comes out of your body it expires quicker than avocados in hawaii  youve got  you have  a  window before theres  an exponential decreasing probability of  im   fine ill go home ill medically ejaculate ill come back in  minutes no problem so i go home open the front door ejaculate immediately  this is   this is home court advantage i know where everything is i know whats behind me i look at the dripping garbage bag  its  a pavlovian response at this point  i ejaculate into a cup  its a cup that they gave me its not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen  that says worlds best dad on it  its the cup that they use doctors give you to test your pee for drugs its got a really tight cap right so i ejaculate into the cup it keeps overflowing so i gotta keep  pouring it out  just overwhelming amounts  its  ghostbusters  up in here   i fill it to the brim and then i scrape off the top and then i and then i seal the cap as tight as i can right get it really nice and tight and then i i put it inside my tshirt next to my skin under my armpit nice and snug because the doctor told me to do that because apparently  the titanic your body heat will keep your people alive and then i run downstairs and i jump into a new york city taxi and im  take me to langone hospital please hurry up the taxi driver is  what the fuck are you doing with your hand are you  im  oh yeah no im fine no its not me its my my wife shes wait a person its my jizz  and new york city taxis have seen much worse so the taxi driver was  oh  cool thank you for using a cup  unlike the last two dudes who were back there just raw dogging at the jfk  what im saying and  we get to the we get to the hospital right i open the taxi door i run into the hospital and because its new york city someone on the sidewalk is  hey yo hey yo were you that guy in shangchi  am i yes i was a minor character in the marvel movie shangchi not the main guy and the guys  yo yo can i get a photo with you and im   sure  so we take a photo  this so

grateful he was  aw thanks so much man and i was  no problem man i shake his hand right  because i love meeting my fans and i run into the hospital right already hitting the  mark end of the fourth quarter theres no time left on the clock so i just take my jizz and i just throw a buzzerbeater right the doctor  catches my jizz    odell beckham she just  one hand grabs it and  in the same motion without even putting it down she  alleyoops my jizz into my wifes eggs right just takes it and she goes boom shakalaka and  my sperm goes into my wifes eggs and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg nobody knows its a mystery its a mystery of the universe nobody knows when sperm goes into the egg its unknowable ooh its its  the event horizon on a black hole no one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes nothing happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes it becomes a bubble tea  nobody knows where bubble tea comes from its tapioca the sperm goes into the egg and then you shake it and you go to vegas you throw it on the crap table and if youre lucky if you get a good dice roll right it becomes a blastocyst thats what we call future humans blastocysts it becomes embryos the doctor shell take all the embryos and shell look at them under the microscope and shell grade the embryos  cocaine  shell be  ooh yeah these ones these are agrade embryos right here   these ones these are these are bgrade embryos so so i dont know  these these ones these are cgrade embryos  oh and these ones yeah these these are these are dgrade embryos yeah

data you just hope youre not throwing away a tom brady in the  round thats going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you cant measure the human spirit and  we all  to think were good people in this room but were all picking the agrade embryos  no one here is not picking your agrade embryos if given a choice even if you were a bgrade embryo  you would still pick your agrade embryos because youll be  i know what its  im not putting my kids through this bgrade human existence with sweaty palms and sciatica  give me the agrade shit give me the best we could do give my kid a fighting chance and it got me thinking about the future a little bit because i never wanted kids i never thought i would have kids the only thing i ever wanted to do my whole life was this standup comedy in america  its the best look at this its the best you are cheering because  this is way better than having kids   so much more fun and lucrative well the blastocysts are real now theres eight of them waiting for me in the cloud   chance of successful implantation with gradea embryos so i guess that makes me a mass murderer in alabama it got me thinking about the future what kind of parent am i gonna be am i gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were or am i gonna be better than my parents were be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck youre supposed to be now and thinking about it turns out im gonna be just as bad as my parents were i can i can feel it i can feel it inside me i can feel the i can feel the chinese inside me i can just feel that high expectation just low tolerance for excuses its in here its right in here its  the default app  you cant delete the calculator app theres no x when you shake it theres no x you can move it off the home screen but its still in the os embedded  in the operating system i can feel the chinese if my blastocyst was real if it entered this reality and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever oh my god look at this blastocyst everybody look look at how beautiful this blastocyst is i love you so much blastocyst i love you much more than i thought i would  and your blastocyst is hugging you back right theyre   i love you too daddy daddy daddy when i grow up i want to be a standup comedian just  you  i just feel the chinese coming on right i just  you take your glasses off  hitler in the bunker  standup comedy are you out of your fucking mind  thats not even a real job what do you think is gonna happen just gonna run around america and tell jokes to strangers who dont give a fuck about your mental health and even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds and make it to even a semiprofessional level as a standup comedian do you think theres any chance in hell youll be funnier than me    dad is a borderline arena act in some markets have you seen my imdb page im in everything i will fucking crush your career osoto gari your mother and i just spent a fortune to make an agrade blastocyst for them to become a bgrade comedian i will never watch anything you do go to law school   is what my father said to me  i do think its tough for straight men in  to sincerely look up selfimprovement on the internet without five weeks later storming the capitol  that mens selfhelp youtube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now  im not saying its the biggest problem in the world clearly but it is a problem  because men were genetically predisposed to seek selfimprovement  were trying to be better people every day believe it or not women  once we hit a certain age  usually we die before then through suicide or environmental factors bmx biking dietary choices but if you can live long enough as a man you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective  you start seeking guidance from outside sources you start looking at watches   every man in this room has or will at some point weve all been there guys weve all done this weve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives and weve been  what a fucking piece of shit  i fucking hate this loser look at this loser fuck this loser i hate this person i need to be a better person let me start by getting fit   let me work on my health that seems  a logical place to start my journey let me control what i can control in here so what do you do as a man you go on youtube right you look up how to lift weights right you press enter you click on the first video its some guy doing kettlebell swings right hell teach you how to lock your core so you dont break your fucking spine and then you do that for two days you feel pretty good about yourself  whoo right and on the third day the same youtube channel has a new video notification alert the men are  whats this new video from kettlebellswinging guy what could he be doing in his new video in the video the kettlebellswinging guy hes doing the new kettlebell exercise the lawnmower hes doing that and then   seconds into the video he just suddenly just stops and he looks really sad and he puts the kettlebell down and he looks straight into the camera and hes  yo guys just real talk for a second all right  kettlebells are great but i just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind  and all the men watching this are  yeah  yeah that makes sense that feels right in here tell me more kettlebellswinging guy  what other advice do you have for all areas of my life including my relationships and financial investments please give me guidance kettlebellswinging guy so what do you do you watch his next video on autoplay then you watch his next video here comes the youtube algorithm with a suggested video and here comes another suggested video and a week later jordan peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men  five weeks later youre storming the capitol dressed  a buffalo    thats a very realistic sequence of events by the way thats not even an exaggerated timeline every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm we all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that mens selfhelp andrew tate masculinity youtube selfhelp algorithm if you dont know anyone who lost their mind  youre the one who lost their mind youre currently in an echo chamber of assholes cause real friends tell you when youre losing your mind its very tragic all these men who are trying to be better people and theyre seeking guidance but that youtube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves theres tragedy in that  all those people they were just trying to lift weights  they werent trying to cause an insurrection they didnt even know what that word meant they were just trying to do this theyre trying to do this they didnt know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis\\u00e0vis their torso right is it  degrees or  degrees  is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you they googled it one time and then five weeks later youre taking a shit on nancy pelosis desk  and the us marshals are garnishing your wages because you take one wrong turn and life moves pretty quick im not saying as a man dont take responsibility for your own actions  im just saying that youtube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys it it sucks men in in a way that i dont think women understand it really preys on that mens need to seek guidance from somewhere its very hard to resist it just draws draws you in thats why fucking mark zuckerberg is trying to mma fight elon musk right now  that guy fell for his own algorithm do you understand mark zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd and for   years now hes just been looking at our data right jerking off every single day just looking at our data jerking off money piling up billions of dollars data jerking off money money jerking off data for  years that loop and who knew after two decades of that one day he just looked at so much data he was  oh shit oh shit he fell into it now hes trying to mmafight elon musk that guy jerked off and came on his own face   its out of control zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality and he invented that shit and he still fell for it what hope does the average man in america have just walking just waddling down the street looking looking for a taco on his phone hes gonna get sucked into his phone he has no chance that fucking guy has no chance because even the good guys in this room were all  on a razors edge to being a piece of shit   that margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razorthin i gotta tell you if you have the means every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge and  what an instagram post could push it either way   it depends on the post was it cute animals or was it boobs  thats gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours i do think as a society we need to  do a better job of identifying  when we have a disagreement with someone whos genuinely trying to have a goodfaith discussion to reach higher understanding and whos just talking shit we are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit and were not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics  for example me right now im just talking shit   this is oneway shittalking i dont care about any of your opinions do not send me any of them i do not care you paid for me i didnt pay a cent for any of you    free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shittalking session if you dont  it take it out on adam smith but if i was having a conversation with someone i disagree with in good faith i would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with thatd be a logical place to start a difficult conversation for example maga make america great again they have a point americas not doing so great right now right our kids math scores are down  our childrens science scores are down when judged according to international metrics  healthcare systems not doing so great wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially there was an implied promise to a generation of americans that if you do certain things work hard go to college be a good person you would have certain outcomes and those outcomes didnt materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decisionmaking positions lowered the capital gains tax  so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year in postworld war ii us leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for national security by making the us dollar the default international trade currency which gave america the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a us financial banking system but consequently increased the value of the us dollar astronomically which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in america  although the logic at the time  was that americans were supposed to upskill en masse away from the menial manufacturing jobs but everyone heres too much of a dumbass to stay school so we just traded domestic manufacturing to asia and the rest of the world at the expense of workingclass families but if you dont read enough  it comes out as lets go brandon  and its  you have a point but you dont have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didnt read enough you gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag theres a book behind the word you gotta keep going you can go at your own pace but you gotta finish the required reading otherwise we cant have a conversation were all catching up to each other im friends with maga im friends with the magas some of them are my good friends  whoo yeah hawaii maga  the friendliest of all maga  aloha maga theyre in hawaii right now making aloha great again i became friends with them because i filmed two seasons of a tv show in hawaii doogie

the loco moco  very passionate people my maga friends and i respect their passion to some extent i do theyre  i love america i would die for this country and i believe them i believe they love america

country i know you wanna die for your country but were losing the engineering jobs to asia right now so if you we need less people to die for their country we need more people to do their homework for their country  do your homework for your country  actually sit down and show the work and  do the thats a more efficient way to show your patriotism if you take that i want to die energy and you put it into homework you will fucking top the school im telling you its skys the limit  dude youll youll solve a lot of problems youll create a lot of jobs youll increase the gdp just do do your homework for your country id rather die  i i thought so i thought that might be i thought that might be the case dyings easy math is hard  these quadratic equations making me suicidal  we try not to talk about politics my maga friends and i out of mutual respect inevitably it comes up some stuff im wrong about some stuff theyre right about but sometimes  their messaging is so convoluted  i cant get to what their core issue actually is because their surface messaging is so chaotic  sometimes theyre  ronny china caused covid but covid isnt real  so is it fine then does it mean its fine i dont know how to feel about it now cause one minus one is zero i dont know what to tell you the the math analogy works for concepts not just numbers you can x is anything why are you yelling at me about china always

selfaccomplished she is im sure your mom could use it fix the driveway invest in infrastructure something  sometimes americans treat their country the way they treat their parents  yeah  i love my mom i love my mom i would die for my mom but fuck her she made her choices  i love being in america i do i love being here i had my options i came here i love being in america because this is the country

their entire lives extremely gullible because these baby boomers they dont have the they dont have the antibodies to deal with the internet completely clueless when they go on now  watching baby boomers go on the internet now is  watching babies wandering into the kitchen by themselves just looking for cookies on the kitchen countertop just  running their hands blindly on the kitchen countertop pulling down knives kitchen knives coming straight down into their eyeballs into  the soft part of their skull they go in the kitchen they open the oven they turn it on they stick their head inside theyre  any pictures of my grandkids in here is this link safe to click on is this link safe to click on is this link safe to click on just falling for every basic bitch internet scam

believing everything they see on the internet i get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last due to the exponential technology growth curve  but this has got to be the biggest gap in human history the information asymmetry right now is just out of control you literally have people in honolulu right now autodriving their tesla cybertrucks as they vape out the window and their phone ai is trading cryptocurrency meanwhile you have baby boomers they cant even rightclick  they cant even rightclick theres one button

how did  that because the font the font is off and the resolution of the image is blurry and that lighting state doesnt make sense for that image and thats not standard dimensions for a news article i cant give you this knowledge its  malcolm gladwells blink ive seen so much shit on the internet my brain instantly filters it youll never have this skill set so just stay off the internet this world is not for you anymore stop making decisions  but anyway respect your elders  its a confucian value maybe if you give your mom some money she wouldnt get scammed so much yeah well think about the correlation between those two phenomena  people always ask me  why do you shit on your mom for money why dont you shit on your dad for money    no i dont talk about my dad because  my dad has no context for show business  we grew up in malaysia  his families are rubber tappers in malaysia my aunts and uncles are still in sitiawan in malaysia right now tapping rubber they have no context for show business very smart people but they dont know this world my dad he was the first guy in his family to get a college education he went to manchester college which has merged with the university of southern new hampshire he got his masters of economics there put himself through it very smart guy and he was a good immigrant he came to america to new hampshire to get his education and when he graduated he went back to malaysia he didnt take anyones job he left  and my dad had the vision to see what i didnt see he knew he had a ceiling on him because of the way he thinks and talks and he went back to malaysia and he was right for him he went back it was the right choice for him he became a very successful corporate executive  he retired to a farm in johor bahru malaysia love farming he retired to a farm thats how much this guy loved it but he had no context for show business so he wouldnt understand anything im doing  he wouldnt understand what im doing in godzilla vs kong hed be  why dont you just run that way  dad i dont control the edit  im just honolulu chinatown shopkeeper no  in this in this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla  im just connecting act  to act  i dont have a say in how this plays out because of that i stopped telling him about what i was doing i felt he wouldnt get it and he stopped asking me so i didnt tell him i got hired on the daily show he found out the way all parents find out about their kids accolades through a local newspaper so one day the local paper reported that i got hired on the daily show and he called me immediately he was  ronny whats this i hear about you joining the everyday show and i was  oh no its the daily show i joined  two years ago dad he was  oh  well whats the daily show im  its just  another latenight american talk show they kind of invented modern american satire and  and  my dad was  oh thats cool are you the host im  no im a correspondent he was  what is that whats a correspondent im  yeah correspondent is i help the host with comedy segments and he was  oh  hey mei hes just a sidekick  and so he had  no context for what was a win what was a milestone in this industry and so i stopped telling him and he stopped asking me and i didnt need that from him we we were totally fine wed talk about other stuff not about work we werent fighting it was all good  and he passed away very suddenly  in  he died on christmas eve died on his farm  no warning no explanation he just left one day he left so suddenly we had to go back to handle his estate if anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position when you have to handle someone elses estate it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life and so its me my wife my sister brotherinlaw went back to johor bahru and part of me trying to figure out his estate was i had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using so his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it and i opened it up and its passwordprotected and i know this guy so well im  his password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child so  i type in my sisters birthday and spot on spot on it was my sisters birthday  as it should be shes  an anesthesiologist in australia shes  way more respectable person than me actually saving lives  a good person contributing back to society not  this fucking asshole i get in  i get in trouble on the internet for shit i said two years ago every six weeks so it should be her she should be the favorite so i log into his computer i open his web browser i look at his browsing history and the whole time im  please dont let me find my dads porn please dont let me find what positions my dad was into even if it was just missionary i wouldnt be able to handle it im gonna have to burn this laptop for real chinese people when we burn things it goes to our ancestors and then my granddad is gonna see it and its  i dont i dont want that for them ill be fine but theyre gonna have an awkward time im considerate  that  so i open the web browser look at his history and way to go dad no porn what a cleancut guy no porn he only went on the internet twice a day  clockwork  am and  pm  the farmer that he was and every time he went on the internet hed only go to two websites each time so the first website hed go to was a local news website and the second website hed go to twice a day every single day was my twitter page  aw so hed be reloading my twitter page twice a day just to see what i was doing and i post stuff  hey honolulu hawaii i sold out five shows  this week whys there so many homeless people here id post stuff  that  and  he would read that and then hed be  i assume hed be  oh ronnys doing  hes in hawaii he sold out some shows and oh i guess theres a lot of homeless people in hawaii  and  that was his quiet way of keeping up with me he never told me that and i never knew that and we never discussed it  which is a very nice sentiment unfortunately  as best as i can tell this is the last tweet my dad read of mine  so as best as i can tell forensically based on internet browsing timestamps the last tweet my dad read of mine and quite possibly the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm was me posting on twitter if youre a baby boomer on twitter i already know youre a fucking loser  now obviously this was not directed towards him i didnt even know he had twitter i didnt even know he knew what twitter was but i stand by the statement   and i know thats kind of a weird way to end the show but    if its any solace  this was his phone when he died  aw that was his  wallpaper and his screensaver and  and i didnt even know and its a photo of me and my wife and were in hawaii and im wearing two leis cause my mom threw one off and i put it on  and  i didnt know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper  and   i i  to i  to think that  that is the last image he saw of me thats what he remembered me by when he left and  i also would  to tell my sister i won  i won it was me it was me you guys have been great

to get this shit over with cause i have to pee in  ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for coming  its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that  i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat  shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through and then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its  to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find out  i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books  fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was  the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost   and everybody thought it was  this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was  the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was  you never know when you might need this and i was  but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success i grew up a lot this past year  this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and  hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was  oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was  oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was  all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had  we had we had so much chemistry he was  hey wassup i was  wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was  hey can you drop me off i was  where he was  at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was  oh no i just fucked a homeless dude again my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who   wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they  to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it  because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude  you feel  youre in a wes anderson movie or something and  white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff  voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff  that and its very  its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel  im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement  just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im  i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer  but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you  you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on  my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was  hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its  making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just  a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night  oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre  i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more  loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell  responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding  between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things  host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse   learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up  filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was  its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was  its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total  private school asians we both are big hippies too we  to backpack through southeast asia we  to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit  that  we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes  freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats  a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel  we are white people doing an impression of asian people  we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were  oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so  i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because  that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre  im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is  shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always  oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013  you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and  very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be  were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be  we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre  but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do  how much shittier food tastes when  you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be  look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im  that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retired i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day  youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically  wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre  oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks  its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to  squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want  its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was  you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently  and he was  hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was  why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes  mrs pacman just lets redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was   youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really  freaked out about anal and theyre  oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel  youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt  i got a second chance at life  i was  oh my god its  im going back in time \\u266a a whole new world \\u266a it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah  a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your\\u2013 just give your man a little\\u2013 a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari  and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont\\u2013 no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they  it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i  that fear that shit turns me on  especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye  hes discovered nirvana and its  youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim  my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when\\u2013 when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right  i respect you right im  yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who  to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their\\u2013 glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control   i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live  i just wanna be out of control for once just\\u2013 just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cunt im just waiting for the right moment to  become a housewife financially  i want my husband to get us to  a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people thats the kind of income bracket im striving for thats when  youve made it when youre eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple  what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking  a princess i have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be  guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are  thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me  a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were  ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was  yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won  another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were  why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was  yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed  a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and  why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were  yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im  oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here  i need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre  im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are  the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because  im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me  im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbusters i dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b  skittles so my uterus probably looked  a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act  everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich  mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were  oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was  only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be  were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its  release the kraken and they just come out  a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship  and  yeah and most of the time  we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be  ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look  they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be  hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymore im very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre  oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was   yeah where im from thats  losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was  no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was  yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was  you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted im scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula  what that is  what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did  that youre gonna poop on the table i was  yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense  that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channel i can already see how theres  this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommy  i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i  i berate my husband on  a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant  your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see  a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then  they get big\\u2013 they get big  fingers  you you you owe me money you my nipples look  whoppers now and naked i look  a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not  when i was  years old when it was  really hot  and i was  why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporin so  i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos  way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and  two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnant all right ive been ali wong have a good night everybody thank you your email address will not

see everything around it for up to ten seconds after its decapitated yeah yeah i never know what to say i never know what to say to someone after theyve lost a baby what do you say to someone after theyve lost a baby oh im sorry for your loss doesnt cut it are you gonna be  not even close thats why i just keep my mouth shut let my lawyer do the talking im not good with kids thats my point thats what this whole things about im not good with kids not gonna lie hell a couple of months ago i dropped my cousins baby flatout dropped my cousins baby on the ground but i dont feel  that was my fault i dont feel responsible for that one  who in their right mind who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me anthony jeselnik to be a pallbearer its  people hate people hate dead baby jokes they hate them they hate them its  anthony why do you have to tell dead baby jokes why do you have so many dead baby jokes no one likes them why do you insist well ill tell you why because dead baby jokes have made me rich and who was it who was it who said the first million is the hardest was it hitler didnt see that one coming did you that was a good response most audiences just pretend i didnt say it but i  it i  making hitler jokes its cool for me i enjoy it hell i lost my grandfather i lost my grandfather in the holocaust museum it was the holocaust museum of modern art which is just  a normal holocaust museum except you walk around all day being  oh i should have thought of that my grandmother died about a year ago and i didnt think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away but i was wrong it was fine the hard part the upsetting part was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted she wanted to die in the best way possible   you radio winner whats the best way you can die this is not a trick question \\u2013 in your sleep \\u2013 yes thank you thank you everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep not me i want to be alert awake surrounded by friends in a house fire but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep we thought thats how she went we were all excited for her but then we did an autopsy found out she actually died horribly in the worst way possible during an autopsy it was fucked up yeah yeah she always said her grandkids didnt pay enough attention to her and and she was right she was dead on but i loved my grandma loved her very much my grandma taught me about a lot taught me what religion is taught me everything you can know about religion in one quick story ill tell you now when i graduated from high school when i graduated my grandma came to me gave me a big hug said anthony im so proud of you youre my first grandchild to get to go to college what can i do for you what can i give you before you go to college and i said honestly grandma all i need from you is money yeah i know you guys have never been but college is expensive and my grandma said  anthony i understand couple months go by its the end of summer im packing up my dads car getting ready to go to school and my grandma walks up says anthony here before you leave take this and she handed me a brandnew bible king james version and i said thanks grandma thats exactly what we talked about i got in the car and i went off to school couple of weeks go by im hanging out in my dorm room having a good time when the phone rings its my grandma anthony just calling to see how college is going grandma college is the best im having the time of my life but to be honest im starting to run low on money and i could use a little bit  we talked about she said  well let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said totally grandma im on chapter four she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later hung up the phone couple of months go by now im really starting to struggle financially might have to drop out of school so i call my grandma in a panic i say please its anthony im having the time of my life in college but if i wanna graduate and i do i need you to send me some money  we talked about she said anthony let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said yes grandma i wish it was longer and she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later finally its the end of the school year ive got straight as but im dropping out of college cause i have no more money left and im furious close to tears cleaning out my dorm room when the phone rings its my grandma anthony i heard youre dropping out of school today how come and i said  goddamn well how come grandma cause you wouldnt give me any money she said anthony let me ask you this did you read your bible and i just hung up the phone i was so pissed off took everything out of that room last thing i took off the shelf the last thing i took out of that room was that bible my grandma had given me took it off the shelf held it in my hands and for the first time i actually opened it up and on the very first page in my grandmothers handwriting it said fuck you thank you everyone i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight and all the jokes i write theyre all made up theyre all fake except for eric clapton and the challenger everything else everything else is fake but everything im about to tell you from here until the end of the show thats all true now i dont tell dark jokes because im a comedian im a comedian because i tell dark jokes im kind of fucked up all right ive always been this way i cant really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends its ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyones funeral i asked a friend for advice was  ive never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and dont tell a joke try not to so i walked up and was   what my favorite memory was when i was  four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it  mark twain out of my grandmas mouth it would just come to life and then i couldnt help myself i said and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the n word now i promise you i promise you until youve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wifes funeral at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think im one of the best comedians of all time but heres the thing it doesnt matter if you believe me it really doesnt matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i  to test myself i  to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i  to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i dont believe in too soon im on a tight schedule and im good at it im good at it  the day of the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted other than that how was the movie right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that the reason i get away with stuff  that is im just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didnt make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i dont follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying dont do it and whenever i see that whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad cause i know something horrible has happened people will say anthony whats funny about aurora whats funny about the boston marathon whats funny about your grandmothers funeral nothing nothing is funny about those things thats where i come in so i see these texts and im  oh no what happened but i also think ive got a job to do so i go online i start reading about it i dont want to watch the footage but ill read about what happened and i think how can i make someone laugh today and then i think i got it i go back on twitter and i tweet guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed especially the finish line and again i think nailed it usa usa but then my phone starts to ring and its my boss or should i say my former boss and they say anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today youre also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or youre fired and i say go fuck yourselves and i meant it i didnt get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because im dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said sure they said well anthony you dont understand you dont understand at all if you dont take this joke down right now if you dont delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people theyre also out of a job and im ashamed to tell you this im embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke cause im happy to fight for what i believe in im happy to take the consequences for what ive done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet couldnt do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now ill tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in im just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture theyre  anthony were family why are you so upset cant you see we did you a favor dont you worry about your career let me ask you san francisco do i seem  i worry about my career no  why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if theyre worried about their money they wouldnt have played the lottery in the first fuckin place i do not worry about my career and they said anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems  youre making fun of the victims and thats wrong but thats not what im doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell me im wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking hey are we trending no this is who im making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston do  what thats worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying dont forget about me today dont forget about me lots of crazy distractions in the news but dont forget how sad i am those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of theyre  a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understand now im sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it its fine its embarrassing but its fun you can laugh at yourself its not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me thats fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess thats what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called shark party all right now some of you enjoyed it but if youve never seen shark party you can never see shark party its been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year  million sharks are killed by human beings every year   people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack im  fuck yeah win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say  what i want to have a shark party as soon as theres a shark attack were having a shark party and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do ive already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark its time for a shark party lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing ive ever said on television smile you son of a bitch shark party and in america where im famous for those types of shenanigans everybody was  anthony that was fucked up it was fucked up to see you dance end of controversy however in new zealand where they dont get my show theyve never seen me and frankly they dont get out much the new zealand media takes the video and they show it to the guys family and they say what do you guys think about this and they say crikey or whatever the fuck they say over there the point is all of new zealand all of new zealand rises up against me all  of those cunts rise up and start threatening my life now i dont read the things that people write about me on the internet but i pay people who do and they come to me and theyre  weve got some terrible news please sit down they say you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of shark party and i was  really new zealand wants to kill me thats weird because they didnt even kill the shark i said how many death threats am i getting and they were  oh all of them you are getting all of the death threats what do you want us to do we can send someone to talk to them extra security what do you want i said no forget about it leave it alone dont worry this might be hard for some to understand ive said it several times tonight everyone is going to die i know full well i am going to die and most of us dont get to choose how we check out but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes best case scenario if somebody murders me over one of my jokes i immediately become a legend im a comedy god the mount rushmore of comedy is me four times i said come on then my security guys are   anthony well just so  that is the dumbest thing weve ever heard but youre the boss  and they leave and then the next day they come back and they say anthony sorry to bother you again i know you didnt care yesterday but its gotten much worse youre gonna wanna hear this they say someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dads phone number and address in pittsburgh posted that online and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand and i have to admit that had never occurred to me before it never crossed my mind that my family my loved ones would ever pay the price be caught in harms way for something ive done or ive joked about and honestly i would cut my throat for my jokes i would give my life for what i do but if anyone and i mean this for a fact if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke ive made even better this man is fantastici watched the show  times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable  great material so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is  but a joke about a famous musicians son falling to his death isnt  where are your

without even putting it down she  alleyoops my jizz into my wifes eggs right just takes it and she goes boom shakalaka and  my sperm goes into my wifes eggs and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg nobody knows its a mystery its a mystery of the universe nobody knows when sperm goes into the egg its unknowable ooh its its  the event horizon on a black hole no one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes nothing happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes it becomes a bubble tea  nobody knows where bubble tea comes from its tapioca the sperm goes into the egg and then you shake it and you go to vegas you throw it on the crap table and if youre lucky if you get a good dice roll right it becomes a blastocyst thats what we call future humans blastocysts it becomes embryos the doctor shell take all the embryos and shell look at them under the microscope and shell grade the embryos  cocaine  shell be  ooh yeah these ones these are agrade embryos right here   these ones these are these are bgrade embryos so so i dont know  these these ones these are cgrade embryos  oh and these ones yeah these these are these are dgrade embryos yeah these these will storm the capitol someday  so  you dont want that and then  and then you have to  draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics and you dont know youre just projecting data you just hope youre not throwing away a tom brady in the  round thats going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you cant measure the human spirit and  we all  to think were good people in this room but were all picking the agrade embryos  no one here is not picking your agrade embryos if given a choice even if you were a bgrade embryo  you would still pick your agrade embryos because youll be  i know what its  im not putting my kids through this bgrade human existence with sweaty palms and sciatica  give me the agrade shit give me the best we could do give my kid a fighting chance and it got me thinking about the future a little bit because i never wanted kids i never thought i would have kids the only thing i ever wanted to do my whole life was this standup comedy in america  its the best look at this its the best you are cheering because  this is way better than having kids   so much more fun and lucrative well the blastocysts are real now theres eight of them waiting for me in the cloud   chance of successful implantation with gradea embryos so i guess that makes me a mass murderer in alabama it got me thinking about the future what kind of parent am i gonna be am i gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were or am i gonna be better than my parents were be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck youre supposed to be now and thinking about it turns out im gonna be just as bad as my parents were i can i can feel it i can feel it inside me i can feel the i can feel the chinese inside me i can just feel that high expectation just low tolerance for excuses its in here its right in here its  the default app  you cant delete the calculator app theres no x when you shake it theres no x you can move it off the home screen but its still in the os embedded  in the operating system i can feel the chinese if my blastocyst was real if it entered this reality and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever oh my god look at this blastocyst everybody look look at how beautiful this blastocyst is i love you so much blastocyst i love you much more than i thought i would  and your blastocyst is hugging you back right theyre   i love you too daddy daddy daddy when i grow up i want to be a standup comedian just  you  i just feel the chinese coming on right i just  you take your glasses off  hitler in the bunker  standup comedy are you out of your fucking mind  thats not even a real job what do you think is gonna happen just gonna run around america and tell jokes to strangers who dont give a fuck about your mental health and even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds and make it to even a semiprofessional level as a standup comedian do you think theres any chance in hell youll be funnier than me    dad is a borderline arena act in some markets have you seen my imdb page im in everything i will fucking crush your career osoto gari your mother and i just spent a fortune to make an agrade blastocyst for them to become a bgrade comedian i will never watch anything you do go to law school   is what my father said to me  i do think its tough for straight men in  to sincerely look up selfimprovement on the internet without five weeks later storming the capitol  that mens selfhelp youtube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now  im not saying its the biggest problem in the world clearly but it is a problem  because men were genetically predisposed to seek selfimprovement  were trying to be better people every day believe it or not women  once we hit a certain age  usually we die before then through suicide or environmental factors bmx biking dietary choices but if you can live long enough as a man you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective  you start seeking guidance from outside sources you start looking at watches   every man in this room has or will at some point weve all been there guys weve all done this weve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives and weve been  what a fucking piece of shit  i fucking hate this loser look at this loser fuck this loser i hate this person i need to be a better person let me start by getting fit   let me work on my health that seems  a logical place to start my journey let me control what i can control in here so what do you do as a man you go on youtube right you look up how to lift weights right you press enter you click on the first video its some guy doing kettlebell swings right hell teach you how to lock your core so you dont break your fucking spine and then you do that for two days you feel pretty good about yourself  whoo right and on the third day the same youtube channel has a new video notification alert the men are  whats this new video from kettlebellswinging guy what could he be doing in his new video in the video the kettlebellswinging guy hes doing the new kettlebell exercise the lawnmower hes doing that and then   seconds into the video he just suddenly just stops and he looks really sad and he puts the kettlebell down and he looks straight into the camera and hes  yo guys just real talk for a second all right  kettlebells are great but i just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind  and all the men watching this are  yeah  yeah that makes sense that feels right in here tell me more kettlebellswinging guy  what other advice do you have for all areas of my life including my relationships and financial investments please give me guidance kettlebellswinging guy so what do you do you watch his next video on autoplay then you watch his next video here comes the youtube algorithm with a suggested video and here comes another suggested video and a week later jordan peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men  five weeks later youre storming the capitol dressed  a buffalo    thats a very realistic sequence of events by the way thats not even an exaggerated timeline every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm we all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that mens selfhelp andrew tate masculinity youtube selfhelp algorithm if you dont know anyone who lost their mind  youre the one who lost their mind youre currently in an echo chamber of assholes cause real friends tell you when youre losing your mind its very tragic all these men who are trying to be better people and theyre seeking guidance but that youtube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves theres tragedy in that  all those people they were just trying to lift weights  they werent trying to cause an insurrection they didnt even know what that word meant they were just trying to do this theyre trying to do this they didnt know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis\\u00e0vis their torso right is it  degrees or  degrees  is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you they googled it one time and then five weeks later youre taking a shit on nancy pelosis desk  and the us marshals are garnishing your wages because you take one wrong turn and life moves pretty quick im not saying as a man dont take responsibility for your own actions  im just saying that youtube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys it it sucks men in in a way that i dont think women understand it really preys on that mens need to seek guidance from somewhere its very hard to resist it just draws draws you in thats why fucking mark zuckerberg is trying to mma fight elon musk right now  that guy fell for his own algorithm do you understand mark zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd and for   years now hes just been looking at our data right jerking off every single day just looking at our data jerking off money piling up billions of dollars data jerking off money money jerking off data for  years that loop and who knew after two decades of that one day he just looked at so much data he was  oh shit oh shit he fell into it now hes trying to mmafight elon musk that guy jerked off and came on his own face   its out of control zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality and he invented that shit and he still fell for it what hope does the average man in america have just walking just waddling down the street looking looking for a taco on his phone hes gonna get sucked into his phone he has no chance that fucking guy has no chance because even the good guys in this room were all  on a razors edge to being a piece of shit   that margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razorthin i gotta tell you if you have the means every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge and  what an instagram post could push it either way   it depends on the post was it cute animals or was it boobs  thats gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours i do think as a society we need to  do a better job of identifying  when we have a disagreement with someone whos genuinely trying to have a goodfaith discussion to reach higher understanding and whos just talking shit we are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit and were not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics  for example me right now im just talking shit   this is oneway shittalking i dont care about any of your opinions do not send me any of them i do not care you paid for me i didnt pay a cent for any of you    free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shittalking session if you dont  it take it out on adam smith but if i was having a conversation with someone i disagree with in good faith i would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with thatd be a logical place to start a difficult conversation for example maga make america great again they have a point americas not doing so great right now right our kids math scores are down  our childrens science scores are down when judged according to international metrics  healthcare systems not doing so great wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially there was an implied promise to a generation of americans that if you do certain things work hard go to college be a good person you would have certain outcomes and those outcomes didnt materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decisionmaking positions lowered the capital gains tax  so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year in postworld war ii us leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for national security by making the us dollar the default international trade currency which gave america the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a us financial banking system but consequently increased the value of the us dollar astronomically which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in america  although the logic at the time  was that americans were supposed to upskill en masse away from the menial manufacturing jobs but everyone heres too much of a dumbass to stay school so we just traded domestic manufacturing to asia and the rest of the world at the expense of workingclass families but if you dont read enough  it comes out as lets go brandon  and its  you have a point but you dont have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didnt read enough you gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag theres a book behind the word you gotta keep going you can go at your own pace but you gotta finish the required reading otherwise we cant have a conversation were all catching up to each other im friends with maga im friends with the magas some of them are my good friends  whoo yeah hawaii maga  the friendliest of all maga  aloha maga theyre in hawaii right now making aloha great again i became friends with them because i filmed two seasons of a tv show in hawaii doogie

the loco moco  very passionate people my maga friends and i respect their passion to some extent i do theyre  i love america i would die for this country and i believe them i believe they love america

country i know you wanna die for your country but were losing the engineering jobs to asia right now so if you we need less people to die for their country we need more people to do their homework for their country  do your homework for your country  actually sit down and show the work and  do the thats a more efficient way to show your patriotism if you take that i want to die energy and you put it into homework you will fucking top the school im telling you its skys the limit  dude youll youll solve a lot of problems youll create a lot of jobs youll increase the gdp just do do your homework for your country id rather die  i i thought so i thought that might be i thought that might be the case dyings easy math is hard  these quadratic equations making me suicidal  we try not to talk about politics my maga friends and i out of mutual respect inevitably it comes up some stuff im wrong about some stuff theyre right about but sometimes  their messaging is so convoluted  i cant get to what their core issue actually is because their surface messaging is so chaotic  sometimes theyre  ronny china caused covid but covid isnt real  so is it fine then does it mean its fine i dont know how to feel about it now cause one minus one is zero i dont know what to tell you the the math analogy works for concepts not just numbers you can x is anything why are you yelling at me about china always

selfaccomplished she is im sure your mom could use it fix the driveway invest in infrastructure something  sometimes americans treat their country the way they treat their parents  yeah  i love my mom i love my mom i would die for my mom but fuck her she made her choices  i love being in america i do i love being here i had my options i came here i love being in america because this is the country

believing everything they see on the internet i get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last due to the exponential technology growth curve  but this has got to be the biggest gap in human history the information asymmetry right now is just out of control you literally have people in honolulu right now autodriving their tesla cybertrucks as they vape out the window and their phone ai is trading cryptocurrency meanwhile you have baby boomers they cant even rightclick  they cant even rightclick theres one button

cant give you this knowledge its  malcolm gladwells blink ive seen so much shit on the internet my brain instantly filters it youll never have this skill set so just stay off the internet this world is not for you anymore stop making decisions  but anyway respect your elders  its a confucian value maybe if you give your mom some money she wouldnt get scammed so much yeah well think about the correlation between those two phenomena  people always ask me  why do you shit on your mom for money why dont you shit on your dad for money    no i dont talk about my dad because  my dad has no context for show business  we grew up in malaysia  his families are rubber tappers in malaysia my aunts and uncles are still in sitiawan in malaysia right now tapping rubber they have no context for show business very smart people but they dont know this world my dad he was the first guy in his family to get a college education he went to manchester college which has merged with the university of southern new hampshire he got his masters of economics there put himself through it very smart guy and he was a good immigrant he came to america to new hampshire to get his education and when he graduated he went back to malaysia he didnt take anyones job he left  and my dad had the vision to see what i didnt see he knew he had a ceiling on him because of the way he thinks and talks and he went back to malaysia and he was right for him he went back it was the right choice for him he became a very successful corporate executive  he retired to a farm in johor bahru malaysia love farming he retired to a farm thats how much this guy loved it but he had no context for show business so he wouldnt understand anything im doing  he wouldnt understand what im doing in godzilla vs kong hed be  why dont you just run that way  dad i dont control the edit  im just honolulu chinatown shopkeeper no  in this in this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla  im just connecting act  to act  i dont have a say in how this plays out because of that i stopped telling him about what i was doing i felt he wouldnt get it and he stopped asking me so i didnt tell him i got hired on the daily show he found out the way all parents find out about their kids accolades through a local newspaper so one day the local paper reported that i got hired on the daily show and he called me immediately he was  ronny whats this i hear about you joining the everyday show and i was  oh no its the daily show i joined  two years ago dad he was  oh  well whats the daily show im  its just  another latenight american talk show they kind of invented modern american satire and  and  my dad was  oh thats cool are you the host im  no im a correspondent he was  what is that whats a correspondent im  yeah correspondent is i help the host with comedy segments and he was  oh  hey mei hes just a sidekick  and so he had  no context for what was a win what was a milestone in this industry and so i stopped telling him and he stopped asking me and i didnt need that from him we we were totally fine wed talk about other stuff not about work we werent fighting it was all good  and he passed away very suddenly  in  he died on christmas eve died on his farm  no warning no explanation he just left one day he left so suddenly we had to go back to handle his estate if anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position when you have to handle someone elses estate it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life and so its me my wife my sister brotherinlaw went back to johor bahru and part of me trying to figure out his estate was i had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using so his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it and i opened it up and its passwordprotected and i know this guy so well im  his password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child so  i type in my sisters birthday and spot on spot on it was my sisters birthday  as it should be shes  an anesthesiologist in australia shes  way more respectable person than me actually saving lives  a good person contributing back to society not  this fucking asshole i get in  i get in trouble on the internet for shit i said two years ago every six weeks so it should be her she should be the favorite so i log into his computer i open his web browser i look at his browsing history and the whole time im  please dont let me find my dads porn please dont let me find what positions my dad was into even if it was just missionary i wouldnt be able to handle it im gonna have to burn this laptop for real chinese people when we burn things it goes to our ancestors and then my granddad is gonna see it and its  i dont i dont want that for them ill be fine but theyre gonna have an awkward time im considerate  that  so i open the web browser look at his history and way to go dad no porn what a cleancut guy no porn he only went on the internet twice a day  clockwork  am and  pm  the farmer that he was and every time he went on the internet hed only go to two websites

baby boomer on twitter i already know youre a fucking loser  now obviously this was not directed towards him i didnt even know he had twitter i didnt even know he knew what twitter was but i stand by the statement   and i know thats kind of a weird way to end the show but    if its any solace  this was his phone when he died  aw that was his  wallpaper and his screensaver and  and i didnt even know and its a photo of me and my wife and were in hawaii and im wearing two leis cause my mom threw one off and i put it on  and  i didnt know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper  and   i

              " ['wow hey thank you thanks thank you guys hey seattle nice to see you look at this look at us were here this is crazy its insane so about five years ago pretty much everyone who i know started to get married and that was strange for me because i dont really believe in the idea of marriage and that would have been fine except i have a problem where sometimes when i think that i am right about something it can be a real source of tension between me and the person im arguing with and the reason its a source of tension is that im right and so i remember distinctly talking to my friend dana and she goes well you dont believe in marriage for you but of course you believe in it for other people and i was  no i think its insane  for anyone and she said whyand i said well first of all it just seems doomed   of marriages end in divorce thats just first marriages by the way second marriages  to  end in divorce third marriages  to  end in divorce thats a learning curvesecond of all monogamys impossible or at the very least not a sure thing when i say that i think people assume that im implying that men are incapable of being faithful i think women are just as incapable but for more sophisticated reasons  i mean with men were just really simple we have a very simple sexuality when i say that my female friends are  well we  sex just as much as you do and i said sure but its different and they say how and i say have you ever masturbated while driving a carnumber three im never gonna be happy why would anyone want to be a part of that i think thats not brought up often enough i  i didnt know that would be the reaction oh no thats the hopeful part the  i had one ally in all this which is my friend andy and hes a comedian as well not only did we decide we werent gonna get married we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married yeah we were pretty good at it  we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages  we were we were pretty good i mean we werent  the best in the world im sure there are better in europe but we were we were solid   so  for example at point my friend alex was about to get engaged and so we just took him to dinner and during dessert we gave him a long hard stare we said are you sure this is what you want to do and then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel  when we werent friends anymore so february   im at andys house in los angeles and earlier in the night i got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone and it was a bad one because i knew that i was right and andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation cause hes the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether youre right he says stuff  she sounds crazy  even if what shes saying isnt that crazy  youd be  she only eats whole wheat bagels hed be  she sounds crazy youd be  thats not even the crazy part  so im telling him about his argument and he goes youre right i go i know im right he goes yeah youre right i go i know im right i got to tell her about this in the morning and i get in my rental car to head back to my hotel and im driving out of andys small road and im tboned i dont know if youre familiar with this term  this is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car drivers side at a  angle  a tbone steak and in   seconds im spun around and i think im dead no wait im paralyzed and then i hear nothing and then i hear the other car skid out and drive away i know let me tell you how this argument started i met jenny in st louis my friend andy and i were working for her company they were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches which is really my demographic i  no i was very nervous about this i was actually kind of about to go onstage and i was  scrawling notes on my napkin a lot of times ill write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary and jenny looked at me and she goes what are you doing and i said im writing my set list and then she goes i think itll be fine and i was  no it wont be fine and then she was  i think it will be  and i said why do you think that and she said well you look so nervous i think theyll feel sorry for you but jenny has this really soft sweet voice  the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything at one point she said it seems  you comedians are a lot funnier onstage normally id be offended by that but in this instance i was  you are right that is a great point you are beautiful  she re she really was  from the moment i met jenny i knew i wanted to sleep with her at least once stay with me  i mean i mean that in  in the most meaningful way  that was the most that i was capable of in my life at that point i id jus id just come off a really long difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married and and then we werent and then when we werent i was so heartbroken i just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely  and but from the moment i met jenny i just wanted to be with her and i didnt i didnt think it was gonna happen  i dont have that kind of confidence i actually think of myself as a sex maybe which is to say that if im seeing a girl shed think id have sex with him maybe  and im im not ashamed of that there were periods in my life where i was a sex never or a sex with self always yeah and often surprisingly often yeah i just dont give off a great first impression  ill give you an example ',\n",

and the guy comes by with fried dough and im  next time  thats how i go for fried dough cause i have a problem i just this is ridiculous can you follow me over here for a second im gonna jump off stage this is only in seattle where someone is wearing no shoes no shoes or socks what who are you people what is wrong with you i would expect that behavior from this guy but not you sir not you what is this where do you think you are from seattle yeah seattle so ive been going  recently to a womens exercise class iive given up on having a traditional male physique and so now im going for strong independent woman and  its going pretty well  im not as good in the class as you might think sometimes ill kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isnt looking but then when she looks over i always have to strike a pose as though ive been doing what everybody else has been doing it reminds me of the olympics  how they do gymnastics how theyll have those the girls will do those crazy flips and twirls and every once in a while and im not saying i root for this to happen but sometimes theyll fall and its ugly cause theyre rolling around  im in a lot of trouble  i dont even know how i got here but at the end of that no matter what and i totally fall for it im  that cant possibly be the same loser from moments ago i mean thats a completely different person this person has much better posture for starters i really wanted jenny to come out with me and andy that night in st louis cause we were going out to one of these famous irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak and so i thought that might work to my advantage i dont know and  i didnt have the nerve to ask her myself and so i convinced andy to ask her for us and  pfft which yeah i dont know if that was the best idea cause  were heading were in the car heading to the pub and jenny says oh i left my id at the hotel and i was  oh we can just swing back and get it and shes  shes  no itll be fine i was  no it wont be fine cause its st patricks day and theres bouncers and she goes no itll be  and i was  no it wont be  and then we get to the pub and it was fine  the bouncer just kind of waved her through which has not been my experience with bouncers for me bouncers are  prison guards and for jenny theyre  birthday clowns   what can i do to make your day betteryou know and thats were at the pub and it had taken so much convincing for andy to get jenny to come out there by the time she came out she thought she was on a date with him and yeah that wasnt the idea and so i said i had to convince him to fall away as the night went on  the red rockets on the space shuttle and eventually she realized she was on a date with me and she was not happy about that but  but she warmed to me as the night went on cause she was drinking and then  no by the end of the night we were laughing and having a good time and we i caught a break which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends and she and i were stuffed in this little back seat together and it was really quiet so i could hear her soft voice and she told me she had just come off a long difficult breakup and i told her about my breakup and for a moment there in the back seat it felt  we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart and we get back to the hotel and i offer to walk her to her room and she says sure we get to her door and i didnt want this night to end and so i build up the courage to lean in to kiss her and she says oh no thank you which i thought was polite but disappointing i mean theres something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because youre really putting yourself out there youre just  i think we should connect mouths  and the other persons  i do not think we should connect mouths and those are theyre two very different mouth agendas  and then you just feel so stupid youre  i never should have suggested we connect mouths  this is a sore subject for me i have sort of a long history of failed kisses  i i remember growing up  when people started making out  in my time in massachusetts it was in seventh grade i remember i remember it  it was yesterday cause i was shocked i was  people we know are just making out with other people we know but how  it seemed  an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden i was  i am not doing that and collectively all the girls in my class were  that is fine you are not on the list youre not exactly a firstround draft pick for our new activity i was  perfect it seemed so gross to me and it still does kind of  sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from t',\n",
              "  'hese guys who are  i dont  when i see two dudes making out in the street and i feel that way about anyone  making out is just sloppy its  watching a dog eat spaghetti thats how i make out is that right does anybody know if thats right  good so in seventh grade i was  im not gonna make out with anybody and that was fine for a while but increasingly it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts it was  the makeout club and the nonmakeout club and these were informal organizations of course i mean i would be sad if that were schoolsanctioned  we call this meeting of the nonmakeout club to order first order of business nintendo second order of business why doesnt anyone  us meeting adjourned i dont know it was a sad group and we were losing good guys by the day i feared i feared that soon i would be the lone member of the nonmakeout club so i was  i got to try to get into the makeout club but it was a very intangible goal i didnt really talk to a lot of girls and there was one girl who sat in front of me in class named lisa bazetti who i had a huge crush on but she was way out of my league  she had many suitors she had i dont the rest of the show is in old english  she doth had many suitors  no she had many  admirers and there were three of us really and i was in third place in all the trade publications but i had one advantage over these other guys which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework thanks to alphabetical order bazetti birbiglia one time i said something on the phone that made her laugh and i was  oh this is great i got to do that more and one time we were on the phone and she was laughing so hard i remember so well cause she goes mike you got to stop im gonna pee myself and i was  wow this was the closest id ever come to a vagina so spent the next  years trying to get lisa bazetti to pee and thats how i ended up here yeah thats how we all ended up here in a sense so  so heres what happened with lisa one time i built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me and she said yes i couldnt believe it  all of a sudden i thought well maybe this will be  one of those romantic comedy montages well go to the carnival well get stuck on the top of the ferris wheel well make out itll all take a minute and a half and it will be set to phil collins song but i think that when youre  years old you just dont understand certain things about your digestive system you dont know that you shouldnt eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler cotton candy being the most insane of these items its basically saying were gonna take sugar which everyone knows is bad but then well dress it up  insulation and im  im not sure what the selling point is there is it the sugar or the insulation theyre  we already sold it im  well done way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates i dont know if you have the scrambler here in seattle i imagine you might it travels on a truck it is a very mobile scrambling unit the premise is very simple you just sit on a twoperson pod with the person you are in love with and that pod goes in a circle which is part of a larger circle which is part of an even grander circle as i understand it it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients it was called the shits of pantserator and it was wildly successful and then it was coopted by the carnival workers of america cwoa and they said they said we  it but we do feel  the name is a little bit of a turnoff and then one guy says well what about the i think im gonna dieerator and theyre  thats good cause it gets across the essence of how you feel when youre on the machine plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea which is a nice homage to the original intention of the machine but we still feel  the name might be a little bit of a turnoff and then one guy goes well what about the scrambler cause it scrambles you theyre  we get it frank but who frank is a maniac this guy cant be stopped but every once in a while hes got a good idea but who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment and this one guy goes well i have a nephew whos  years old and smokes pot  hours a day i feel  he might be available and theyre  he sounds amazing we dont even need to interview him he sounds completely qualifiedi sit down with lisa on the scrambler and im feeling good  shes snuggling up close to me and im thinking im thinking  this could be it this could be where its all gonna happen this is very special and then they put that bar seat belt down and the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment its not a ralph nader approved item i dont think its saved lives i think the only thing its ever done is in a scrambler accident its just sort of held someones esophagus down to the pavement making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident first rule of scrambler accident dont talk about scrambler accident thats from scrambler club well i knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that i was going to throw up for sure and i even said to the  stoner i was  hey actually and then he was gone apparently he doesnt enjoy the second halves of sentencesso then im scrambling and as i am scrambling im thinking i need to come up with a plan of some kind im not going down without a fight my first plan was very simple it was ju',\n",
              "  'st dont look at lisa dont look at any other people i was  dont look at lisa dont look at any other people dont look at lisa dont look at any other people i need a new plan and the new plan was i needed to tell the scrambler operator that he needed to stop the ride but the mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window so im  i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride please stop the ride and im back im not sure he heard me i got to say it louder please stop the ride im not sure hes paying attention i think he might be smoking pot right now the third time i said please stop and then i started throwing up and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler just popcorn peanuts insulation really insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa i did not look at lisa but im pretty sure she was staring at me because i was a spectacle at that point i was spectacular and we did not make out i did not lose my mouth virginity that evening two years later it gets worse  im at the st johns high school what they call a cattle call dance this is an all boys catholic school i attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty st johns gymnasium  cattle which is a friendly way to describe women  so cattle shows up at  well make out with the cattle cattle goes home at  then we go out for burgers completely separate from the cattle analogy it was a horrible affair it was just  this room chockfull of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out at this point i was indeed the lone member of the nonmakeout club but it was actually worse than that cause i had to lie to my friends and tell them i had had my first kiss cause it was  this really tough all boys school and so when they would ask  oh have you had your first kiss id be  yeah  all the time  every every week i always feared at some point thered be a followup question  oh yeah whats it  and id be  yeah  its just  licking an ice cream cone and theyd be  no its not its  sucking on a rocket pop and id be  ah wrong frozen dessert analogy im at the dance and im flanked by my friend sam ricciardi and were introduced by our friend tom to these girls from his town they were the last two cows at the dance they were  moo and we were  moo and then sam says one of these phrases i think weve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat he says you get that one which i know its the worst turn of phrase but im comfortable saying it cause i know ive been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me you get that one and then her friend goes  oof  or even worse or even worse  you owe me which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance i would hate to hurt someones credit score  so he goes he goes you get that one and then im just fast dancing with this girl sandra to young mcs bust a move and im not great at fast dancing but they had the strobe light going so its only catching me one out of every five hey so shes losing interest but at  the speed and then im saved by a slow song stairway to heaven which is a classic makeout anthem led zeppelin eight minutes long whats great about slow dancing is you cant really mess it up cause its just sort of a slowmotion hug  the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it shed be  what are you doing and id be  i dont pick up on social cues  but its such a long song  stairway so im just trying not to fidget im sort of a fidgety person i feared if i fidgeted too much i might initiate the head tilt too early i didnt know anything about making out but id seen people do it i could see theres  a head tilt i had heard there were tongues involved and i could see that there was  some kind of space in between the two mouths to me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing what is happening in that space there is no  theres no video documentation of that area its  the giant squid of making out no one has seen it alive theyve only seen it washed up on the shore which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy but so im trying not to fidget then with   minutes left in stairway to heaven the song hits that crescendo all around me kids start to make the tilt just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me and i was  oh no i dont want to be alone anymore and i make the slightest tilt and then sandra comes in strong and then its an allout mouth war and she had artillery cause she had braces it was  a dog eating spaghetti and the fork as this oral atrocity is taking place all i can think is im not alone anymore im not in the nonmakeout club and all i wanted to do was tell my friends but i couldnt because up until that point id lied and said that id had my first kiss i walked off the dance floor sam was  howd it go dude i had to be  same as always pretty smooth as the week wore on i started to convince myself well maybe it did go well and i should call sandra and this could bud into a relationship of some kind but i got her number from tom and those conversations ended up being very brief  we didnt have a lot to talk about i remember just being  hey you  full house me neither cool all right later  what i mean at certain points i remember getting this vibe from he',\n",
              "  'r kind of  why are you calling me and i remember thinking oh im probably reading into that one too much and and then she stopped calling me back and i was  oh yeah i read into that one perfectly but i just felt so dumb about the whole thing and the worst part is i couldnt even tell my friends until one day i was i was standing by my locker with my friend tom and so i said to him i was  hey whats going on with sandra  she hasnt called me back and tom has this knowing grin on his face i was  what tom was  nothing and i was  what tom was  nothing and i was  what toms  oh i talked to sandra and she said youre the worst kisser shes ever kissed and it was so devastating cause not only was it probably true but i couldnt explain to my friends why it was true i couldnt say that makes sense ive never done that before so instead i had to play it off i had to be  yeah that sounds about right im a terrible kisser thats kind of my thing so i lean in to kiss jenny and she says oh no thank you she agrees to go out with me in new york we were both living in new york and she gave me her number and i typed it in my phone and from that point on she would be jen irish pub nice a few weeks later i took her out to a restaurant i couldnt afford to show her how much money i could put on my credit card were out to dinner and she says to me she goes everyone hates me at work and i said why would they hate you i love you she goes you love me i go i mean you seem cool i pulled it back i didnt want to show all my cards just about nine of them one of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said  sometimes ill date two people at once and that way im never let down by either person i said that seems  a really smart plan  id  to do that as well and she said im still kind of seeing my exboyfriend john and you can see other people too but you have to tell me if youre seeing them and i was  all right sounds  a plan got it break i got to go find some more people  and so a few nights later im in another city and i do a show and after the show i went out to a bar and i ended up making out with this random girl then a few nights later im out to dinner with jenny and she says how was your trip and i said it was great i did some shows and then one night i ended up making out with this random girl and that didnt go over very well in the conversation i could sense that something was wrong and i was  but im right about that right  im supposed to tell you if that happens right and she says yeah but it doesnt mean that i wont lose interest in you and i said thats a whole new clause thats a twist what is this the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects i said are you still seeing john and she said sometimes i said well dont you see the contradiction in that and she says yes and it gets very quiet because we were falling in love three weeks into my relationship with jenny i built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to bermuda i wanted to show her how much more money i could put on my credit card since i didnt have a lot left we went to bermuda cause it was the off season you can get these great deals online because as it turns out when its winter in new york it is also winter in bermuda and  jenny and i meet up at the airport and shes late which is a big pet peeve of mine i fancy myself as a professional traveler im always two hours early i have my pocket for my ticket and my passport and i have laceless moccasins i never tell jokes about bombs and and jennys late and then we get to security and im not making this up she doesnt have a license or a passport and i said what do you mean i go how do you travel and she goes well usually they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work id i dont  to dwell on the differences between men and women but i just cant imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport and they would let him on the plane but women get a pass on things  this that i find completely bewildering i mean if i were in charge of alqaeda for example what what i would do is i would recruit attractive women because theyre just not stopped under any circumstances although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the  virgins and  the women wouldnt want that unless theyre lesbians although theres an idea  alqaeda alqaeda could recruit hot lesbians although then theyd have to guarantee that the  virgins are also lesbians i mean what are the odds  all  virgins are also lesbians unless you think of sexuality as  a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity  the  virgins are  i didnt even know i was a lesbian until i had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist and now thats all im into i used to be into these afghani guys who are so crazy theyd die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me and  of my friends but now i dont see khalid in the same way anymore the point is we went to bermuda and were on the flight on the flight and the flight attendant comes over and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us and she says congratulations on your honeymoon and we said oh no thanks were not on our honeymoon and she walks away and jenny says thats so funny i dont think ill ever go on a honeymoon and i said oh really and she goes yeah i dont think id ever want to get married in my life and i said oh really i go me too i said is that based on a principle or ',\n",
              "  'did you have a bad relationship  what was your first boyfriend  and she told me about her first boyfriend brian it was they were at the same bus stop when they were  and they would make out on the bus and they were together for six years and they  their relationship got deeper and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together and i said then what and she said he died he had leukemia and i said well do you ever talk about this with anyone and she says no i dont really  to talk about it but these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where jenny was opening up to me and i was opening up to her and every night wed be up till  or  in the morning and we were so happy we at one point i was  well we should do this again we should go on another trip and you could get a license or a passport jenny said that sounds great but i dont think id get a license or a passport cause they dont make me get one and i was  yeah but its the law  jenny says yeah i dont think ill get one cause they dont make me get one  thats how i feel thats how jenny argues things sometimes shell just say thats how i feel and ill say thats not an argument  were not even in an argument right now because you dont have an argument and shell say i just won that argument and ill say thats not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is and shell say i just won that argument again thats how i feel you could see how this could be a little bit maddening   on our final day on the trip we got into an argument about essentially nothing she noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel and she said we should play and i was  yeah but not  a game and she said why and i said well cause id win and she said no i think i would win i go no i know that id win and i know that what im supposed to say is that the guy says ill win the girl says ill win and the guy lets her win and then she likes him more but i just dont have that in me and jenny goes you dont have to let me win lets go out and play and so we went out and played basketball and i just kicked her ass i mean it was just  it was just   to    to  i mean i was having a good day but still i was just destroying her and at one point she literally said ive never met someone whos so obsessed with the score and i said the score is what makes it a game so were arguing this over lunch and then again it comes up at dinner and then were still arguing about it at  or  in the morning about essentially nothing and she said i dont understand why youre so obsessed with being right i go im not obsessed with it i just am i said why do you think youre right and she says thats how i feel i said if you think im so wrong about everything why are you even with me and jenny says you cant choose who you love which is true but it doesnt mean its good i remember the first time i fell in love i was in high school and it was that first time where you fall in love and youre just  this is it i found her im  years old and im done  and her name was amanda and she was  adorable and funny and what was really exciting for me was that she was  a delinquent  i was  this playbytherules school citizen and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid which i thought was a really strong quality  at one point she was  it was totally messed up because it wasnt even me it was this other girl and i was framed and i was just  awesome  no one would ever frame me for anything i just i thought it was  an opposites attract situation she wanted to know what it was  to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper and i wanted to know what it was  to be cool at one point i was  do you want to write an article for the newspaper she goes i dont want to write an article i want to do things people write articles about and i was  good answeri find that when you fall in love you tend to overlook certain red flags one of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me but then she would pull it back shed be  no one likes you at all only kidding or  youre  a nerd but youre not even smart just joking cant choose who you lovesecond red flag with amanda was that she was a liar and i dont i dont mean that in an offensive way  lying was kind of  a its  a sport at the school i was at i transferred from the all boys school to this coed school there was this one guy in my class named keith robbins who was a legendary liar youd know when he was lying cause he would lick his finger  a bookie and he would dart his eyes from side to side and hed go yeah yeah nice nice  and he wasnt even handling money  i dont even know what this is about and then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant hed be  yeah my uncles tony robbins motivational speaker yeah nice  and we found out that that wasnt even true but even if that were true that wouldnt be impressive to a bunch of high school students but i think thats the jedi level of lying is you lie about little stuff and no one notices when youre lying about big stuff its  bankingthe final red flag with amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend i know im in the future also i think we can all see now cause were so smart and mikes so dumb and   i can also see in retrospect thats a much bigger red flag than i perceived it to be at the time but i was so excited she was even with me at all and she said she h',\n",
              "  'ad another boyfriend at home but they were in the process of breaking up but it was a bad time cause his parents were sick and so i tried to be understanding of that  i went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents and i thought well this is the affirmation that i need im gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend and i drive my moms station wagon to amandas parents house and i walk in the front door and theres amanda and theres her parents and its going well and a few hours go by and this other guy comes over to the house and his name is scott im assuming hes  a family friend or a relative and slowly im noticing similarities between scott and things that amanda has said about her other boyfriend theyre both in their first year in college and theyre competitive wrestlers and its dawning on me that im hanging out with my girlfriends boyfriend and its going pretty well i mean he he seemed  a nice guy i could totally see what she saw in him there was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom she would hold on to my hand and she would say i wish it were just you and me here and i remember thinking you could make that happen the way she said it was as though she werent involved in the decision process  id love to but the boys in corporatewell the day took an even stranger turn when scott suggested that we go hang out at his house and i met his parents it is indescribable meeting your girlfriends boyfriends parents for the first time part of you is angry for obvious reasons but then part of you still wants to make a good impression  youre  maybe if this goes well shell see that im good with adults in general as a side note his parents seemed in perfect health at one point his dad even said to me how do  amanda and i said were just friends from school and i was so ashamed and i felt so dumb and i drove home and i remember thinking i am never gonna let this happen to me again so ten months into my relationship with jenny she invites me to meet her parents and this was a tricky time at this point our relationship was intense but casual which is a dangerous relationship cocktail and it was a hard thing to organize cause i was away probably five days out of the week and so we found a sunday where i was coming back from a fiveday stint in texas which was awful cause it was in texas and i thats thats not to say i dislike texas entirely its such a large thing to dislike and  but that week it felt  texas just disliked me and i just kind of disliked texas back to the point where i developed a small drinking problem which is which is very popular in texas i was performing at a comedy club now comedy i love comedy clubs cause theyre sort of a highlow entertainment proposition  in some ways though theyre the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word and then some of them sell dildo straws   theres  bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends and theyre handing out gummy penises or whatever thats thats actually a thing i didnt even realize that i didnt realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was was the gummy quality of the penis i feel  if i were in charge of the candification of the penis it would be hard candy and then if and then if you suck it down to the gummy part then you just sort of put that off to the side but i but thats thats not my job im  i leave that to the experts but i just i just do the comedy part but i was performing at this club all week and after the late show saturday night i was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things and id been drinking all week and  i always try to be a team player  so i was  whatever i can do to help i dont see how this could end badly and  the next morning i wake up in the my hotel room and im hung over and im groggy and i roll out of bed and i run to the airport to catch my flight im still two hours early and i land in new york and i get a cab to jennys parents house and i walk in the front door and theres jenny and theres her parents and theres her other sort of exboyfriend john and he wasnt front and center  he was just kind of around  he was in the pool  wading and doing laps  that kind of thing but i pulled jenny aside i was  well whats john doing here and she says well he and i arent still together but when we were together he became friends with my stepdad and hes been staying here at their house the last couple weeks and i said  thats not good i feel  that gives him the edge jennys staring at me and i said what she says you have a hickey on your neck and i said i dont think thats true and then i glance at the mirror next to me and realize that in fact i do have a hickey on my neck and i say im really sorry and she says where is that from and i said there was this bachelorette party and i was drunk that sentence never comes out right i mean theres no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even  and we start arguing and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment i didnt have a leg to stand on i was  well what about john what was he doing there she said you have a hickey on your neck i said yeah but at least i told you the truth and she said eventually and i said eventually is better than never and then she kneed me in the balls i dont know if youve ever experienced this before im sure half of you hav',\n",
              "  'e not  its  being electrocuted except you dont get to die its  you want to die but you cant and theres a person in your face saying you deserve this which they wouldnt even do in electrocutions i think they would deem that as inhumane\\xa0 even in texasjenny says i think that we should just break up  its not just this i mean youre away a lot of the time and even when youre here you work at night and i work in the day i just dont think its gonna work out and i said \\xa0 and we were apart for about six months and i missed her so much but i kept resisting calling her cause i wanted to give her space and every once in a while id get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from jen irish pub nice and it would just say hi and id write back hi it was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another but i think in some ways kept us together and finally on new years i caved in and i called her i said hey i really miss you and i want to see you and we got together for coffee and we hit it off just  we used to and we decided we would get back together we had a great period there  i took her to get a license and a passport first we went for her social security card and then we took that to the dmv and then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport it was  the triple crown of identifications jenny was wildly identifiable one night she was heading back from my apartment to hers and she stops and i said what and she says i think that we should live together and i said no i really dont think thats a good idea  ive just decided  as a principle im not gonna get married or live with someone its not personal and she said well unless we live together i just dont think its gonna work out cause we just dont see each other enough and i dont think that we stand a chance thats how i feel so we moved in together and one day jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends and she invites me to come along and i said oh no thanks that doesnt go over so well she says why and i said well as  i dont believe in marriage and so i dont buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it she said well what do you believe in and i said i dont know she said well if you dont believe in anything how can you not believe in marriage and i said well first of all  it just doesnt seem necessary i mean is it  marriage is an archaic institution invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property i dont want to be a part of that second of all i dont even think we have a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is i mean one of me and andys friends was about to get engaged and we were skeptical and we said are you sure this is the person you want to be with for the rest of your life and he goes yeah i think so and we said well what if she gets in a car accident and shes disfigured would you stay with her then and he said maybe that is not an acceptable answer third of all if im so in love why does it need to be written into a government contract and im not one of these  i dont want government up in my business kind of people i think the government does a nice job delivering the mail and suggesting i dont eat poison but i just dont understand why they need to be involved in my personal relationships then finally if marriage is religious shouldnt i believe in the religion ive been to more weddings of my friends where the people on the altar dont believe in the religion of the church theyve invited us to some of them even go to classes with the priest in advance to more elaborately lie about believing in a religion they dont believe in just to have a wedding in a fancy building that is insane thats how i feel so i explain this to jenny and jenny says well if you ever did want to get married i would marry you and i said why arent you listening to any of this and jenny says thats how i feel at this point it was  in the morning wed been arguing all night and we hadnt slept i had to catch a flight at  am out of newark airport to los angeles for a show i was doing that night at this point im overtired and im angry and im late im stuffing my things in my roller suitcase and i walk out of our apartment its  am that part of the morning before the earth even exists before they program the matrix or whatever you walk out of your apartment part of the road isnt even there theres a guy with a laptop going we need a road stat whats the code for building tank  and i get to the airport the news hasnt even started yet its just an anchor looking around  what are you up to and i get to the kiosk and i print up my ticket and i bring it to the security lady and she looks at me and she goes well that aint your gate  i guess they changed the gate but the way she said it was as though i had participated in the decision of changing it i was  i was not involved in this process i wasnt even ccd  as though i had gone to the kiosk and been    hell im flying out of  and then i photoshopped my own ticket printed it out and been  this is where im going  im not that aggressive as a traveler so i was  well where is this gate she goes its in another terminal you got to take a tram she points to the tram and i start walking my roller suitcase and i hear her say and you better run  i guess i was late at that point so i started running and the roller suitcase does not enjoy running the roller suitcase was  i dont want to run i have wheels and i was  i dont want to r',\n",
              "  'un either but this is what we have to do i tell you what when we get to the hotel ill walk you in circles for a few hours then i i get to the tram and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives and it says zero minutes i was  perfect thats exactly how long i want to wait but the trams riding away i was  thats  minute then it says ten minutes and im experiencing that psychological downward spiral  oh great im gonna miss my flight and then im gonna miss every flight from now on and im gonna miss my family reunion and then im not gonna have a family and then im gonna be a crack whore and its  all of a sudden im a crack whore just because i miss this one flight i can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time andi get on the next tram ten minutes later and i run to the gate and im sweaty and im out of breath but im on time and im so relieved that i sit down in a chair at the gate and i fall asleep and i wake up to the sound of the door shutting i jump up and the door is closed and i am on the sad side of the door the happy side has an airplane and a pilot the sad side is me and the cinnabon lady normally id be very excited if it were just me and the cinnabon lady im a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year i think thats an effective use of time but in this instance i needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane and the cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community i was  do  these people she was  all i know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun i ran up to the giant glass window i started pounding on the window  in a romantic comedy i was  drew barrymores character come back she didnt come back and i missed my flight i got on the next one they could get me on there was a stopover in texas  how i feel about texas and  i get to los angeles late that night and id missed my show id never missed one of my shows before and im so angry and jennys calling me but im not picking up the phone cause im blaming this entire day on her i get back to my friend andys house and i said andy this relationship is messing up my entire life and andy goes youre right i go i know im right he goes yeah youre right i go i know im right i got to tell her about this in the morning i drive out of andys small road and im tboned thats the culinary way of describing it in   seconds im spun around and i think im dead no wait im paralyzed and then i hear nothing then i hear the other car skid out and drive away  minutes later im sitting on a curb at this point the police have arri have arrived as well as my friend andy and thats when i start crying  how when you drop a baby on the ground it doesnt doesnt start crying right away because it doesnt understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face and then its  oh i guess i should be doing something that matches that waah im crying because im looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that in that moment i might have ceased to exist  i said earlier i dont really believe in anything so in my mind that would have been the end of all things id experienced in my life every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion and the officer comes over and he says what happened and i said i got hit by this car and then i heard nothing and then i heard the other car skid out and drive away the officer points over to the light the other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree i cant help but think thats karma thats a hit and run and hit and then the officer puts this form in my face and he goes sign this and i said well what does it mean and he goes it means youre  and that we can leave i was really shaken up i was  i dont know if im  and he goes just sign it which is a very unattractive quality when someone just repeats a command that youve just said no to and its unattractive but very effective  i signed it andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution but we have to wait two hours cause the other driver had beat us there and eventually were with the doctor and andy says to him he goes well was the other guy drunk and the doctor says well i cant answer that and andy says was he he uses the technique we had learned earlier and it works  the doctor says well hes heading to jail now and andy and i flash each other a look  the hardy boys  case closed a few hours later were back at andys house its probably around  in the morning and i have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have neardeath experiences i say i need to call jenny and tell her that we need to get married and andy says mike sleep on it and i said no no no this makes perfect sense and i pick up my phone and i dial her number and he puts his hand over the phone and he says mike sleep on it he saves me the next morning i fly back to new york and a few weeks later i get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that i just described and it had found me at fault and that i owed and im not making this up  for the repairs on the other drivers mercedes suv and i was  well this cant be happening i explained to the woman i think its a misunderstanding the other guy was clearly drunk it was definitely not my fault and she said im really sorry but unless they change the accident report you owe this money so i requ',\n",
              "  'ested the accident report and im gonna show you the actual accident report tonight i dont know if youve ever seen one of these things before but its a little bit  homework for cops and officer timson not so good with the homework he consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two vehicle one and vehicle two at one point so badly that he says  thats me started to go but all of a sudden  thats me also came at a high rate of speed crashing into him now im pretty selfdestructive as a person but i would never crash into my own car with my own car nor would i understand how you could do that this part is even crazier the other drivers statement at the scene of the accident was i was on venice going  im not too sure i was going away from the beach i was driving i dont know what happened did i hurt anyone i dont know where i was going but i came from home i had a sip of beer which is really everyones favorite quantity of beer just the one sip right thats what they serve these days at the homebeachpubso all of its mine the officer makes one key mistake he checks the box that finds me at fault so im  i need to get officer timson on the phone so we can clear up this misunderstanding the problem is he keeps ducking my calls and i know cause im calling two or three times a day leaving messages calling departments next to his department so he knows im trying to reach him and finally after a month of this i get him on the phone and im so relieved and i explain this misunderstanding and he listens to me and he says do the right thing and pay for the guys car i know and i mean thats what i said i go arent you listening to any of this i go and this guy was clearly drunk i mean he nearly killed me inches from where he hit and i would be dead right now and he wants me to pay for his car dont you see how crazy that is just as one human being to another and he says do the right thing and pay for the guys car and he hangs up the phone and at this point this stops being about money and its just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law this is chinatown so i started printing up google maps of the scene of the accident and california state driving law im on the phone with lawyers and private investigators theres only one lawyer who would consider the case and he was an accident lawyer and he said did you have any loss of income from the accident and i said no and he says did you have any loss of income from the accident and i said no this isnt about money and he doesnt take the case and this is when i start going completely madim up to about  or  am every night just surfing the web i get a subscription to a site called netdetectivecom which is a great site for vigilantes who have  so now i know this guys name i know where he lives i know what he does for a living and in my mind it becomes  a trailer for a revenge thriller  jim bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this but jim bosworth had another thing coming mike birbiglia i was  im gonna track down jim bosworth im gonna sue jim bosworth and im gonna sue the entire los angeles police department at this point people stopped talking to me entirely my friends would call me  hey whats going on id be  ill tell you whats going on id tell them this whole story and theyd be  you should get a lawyer id be  this is way past lawyers a lawyer wouldnt even touch this cause he wouldntthe only person who would talk to me at this point was jenny one night we were out to dinner at a restaurant and shes talking to me but im not listening cause im writing down ideas i have for the case on my napkin ive drawn out a diagram of the intersection and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in the laws the other driver broke and the phone numbers im gonna call that week and im so angry im writing over my own handwriting to the point where im ripping through the napkin and jenny looks at me and she says what are you doing and i said well this is my case and she says well why dont you work on that in the morning and i said well which part of this napkin dont you understand jenny says mike youre right but its only hurting you and im just so glad that youre alive and i think that we should focus on that she only has to say it once and i give up the case and i pay for this guys car july   jenny and i went to city hall and got married i still didnt believe in the idea of marriage and i still dont but i believe in her and ive given up on the idea of being right thank you guys very much thank you thank you guys

to get this shit over with cause i have to pee in  ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for coming  its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that  i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat  shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through and then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its  to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find out  i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books  fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was  the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost   and everybody thought it was  this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was  the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was  you never know when you might need this and i was  but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success i grew up a lot this past year  this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and  hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was  oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was  oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was  all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had  we had we had so much chemistry he was  hey wassup i was  wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was  hey can you drop me off i was  where he was  at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was  oh no i just fucked a homeless dude again my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who   wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they  to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it  because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude  you feel  youre in a wes anderson movie or something and  white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff  voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff  that and its very  its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel  im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement  just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im  i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer  but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you  you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on  my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was  hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its  making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just  a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night  oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre  i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more  loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell  responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding  between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things  host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse   learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up  filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was  its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was  its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total  private school asians we both are big hippies too we  to backpack through southeast asia we  to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit  that  we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes  freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats  a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel  we are white people doing an impression of asian people  we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were  oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so  i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because  that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre  im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is  shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always  oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013  you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and  very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be  were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be  we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre  but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do  how much shittier food tastes when  you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be  look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im  that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retired i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day  youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically  wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre  oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks  its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to  squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want  its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was  you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently  and he was  hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was  why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes  mrs pacman just lets redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was   youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really  freaked out about anal and theyre  oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel  youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt  i got a second chance at life  i was  oh my god its  im going back in time \\u266a a whole new world \\u266a it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah  a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your\\u2013 just give your man a little\\u2013 a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari  and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont\\u2013 no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they  it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i  that fear that shit turns me on  especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye  hes discovered nirvana and its  youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim  my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when\\u2013 when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right  i respect you right im  yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who  to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their\\u2013 glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control   i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live  i just wanna be out of control for once just\\u2013 just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cunt im just waiting for the right moment to  become a housewife financially  i want my husband to get us to  a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people thats the kind of income bracket im striving for thats when  youve made it when youre eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple  what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking  a princess i have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be  guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are  thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me  a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were  ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was  yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won  another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were  why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was  yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed  a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and  why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were  yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im  oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here  i need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre  im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are  the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because  im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me  im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbusters i dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b  skittles so my uterus probably looked  a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act  everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich  mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were  oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was  only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be  were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its  release the kraken and they just come out  a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship  and  yeah and most of the time  we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be  ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look  they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be  hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymore im very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre  oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was   yeah where im from thats  losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was  no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was  yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was  you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted im scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula  what that is  what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did  that youre gonna poop on the table i was  yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense  that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channel i can already see how theres  this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommy  i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i  i berate my husband on  a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant  your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see  a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then  they get big\\u2013 they get big  fingers  you you you owe me money you my nipples look  whoppers now and naked i look  a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not  when i was  years old when it was  really hot  and i was  why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporin so  i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos  way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and  two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnant all right ive been ali wong have a good night everybody thank you your email address will not

it but i  it i  making hitler jokes its cool for me i enjoy it hell i lost my grandfather i lost my grandfather in the holocaust museum it was the holocaust museum of modern art which is just  a normal holocaust museum except you walk around all day being  oh i should have thought of that my grandmother died about a year ago and i didnt think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away but i was wrong it was fine the hard part the upsetting part was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted she wanted to die in the best way possible   you radio winner whats the best way you can die this is not a trick question \\u2013 in your sleep \\u2013 yes thank you thank you everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep not me i want to be alert awake surrounded by friends in a house fire but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep we thought thats how she went we were all excited for her but then we did an autopsy found out she actually died horribly in the worst way possible during an autopsy it was fucked up yeah yeah she always said her grandkids didnt pay enough attention to her and and she was right she was dead on but i loved my grandma loved her very much my grandma taught me about a lot taught me what religion is taught me everything you can know about religion in one quick story ill tell you now when i graduated from high school when i graduated my grandma came to me gave me a big hug said anthony im so proud of you youre my first grandchild to get to go to college what can i do for you what can i give you before you go to college and i said honestly grandma all i need from you is money yeah i know you guys have never been but college is expensive and my grandma said  anthony i understand couple months go by its the end of summer im packing up my dads car getting ready to go to school and my grandma walks up says anthony here before you leave take this and she handed me a brandnew bible king james version and i said thanks grandma thats exactly what we talked about i got in the car and i went off to school couple of weeks go by im hanging out in my dorm room having a good time when the phone rings its my grandma anthony just calling to see how college is going grandma college is the best im having the time of my life but to be honest im starting to run low on money and i could use a little bit  we talked about she said  well let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said totally grandma im on chapter four she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later hung up the phone couple of months go by now im really starting to struggle financially might have to drop out of school so i call my grandma in a panic i say please its anthony im having the time of my life in college but if i wanna graduate and i do i need you to send me some money  we talked about she said anthony let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said yes grandma i wish it was longer and she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later finally its the end of the school year ive got straight as but im dropping out of college cause i have no more money left and im furious close to tears cleaning out my dorm room when the phone rings its my grandma anthony i heard youre dropping out of school today how come and i said  goddamn well how come grandma cause you wouldnt give me any money she said anthony let me ask you this did you read your bible and i just hung up the phone i was so pissed off took everything out of that room last thing i took off the shelf the last thing i took out of that room was that bible my grandma had given me took it off the shelf held it in my hands and for the first time i actually opened it up and on the very first page in my grandmothers handwriting it said fuck you thank you everyone i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight and all the jokes i write theyre all made up theyre all fake except for eric clapton and the challenger everything else everything else is fake but everything im about to tell you from here until the end of the show thats all true now i dont tell dark jokes because im a comedian im a comedian because i tell dark jokes im kind of fucked up all right ive always been this way i cant really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends its ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyones funeral i asked a friend for advice was  ive never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and dont tell a joke try not to so i walked up and was   what my favorite memory was when i was  four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it  mark twain out of my grandmas mouth it would just come to life and then i couldnt help myself i said and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the n word now i promise you i promise you until youve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wifes funeral at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think im one of the best comedians of all time but heres the thing it doesnt matter if you believe me it really doesnt matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i  to test myself i  to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i  to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i dont believe in too soon im on a tight schedule and im good at it im good at it  the day of the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted other than that how was the movie right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that the reason i get away with stuff  that is im just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didnt make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i dont follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying dont do it and whenever i see that whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad cause i know something horrible has happened people will say anthony whats funny about aurora whats funny about the boston marathon whats funny about your grandmothers funeral nothing nothing is funny about those things thats where i come in so i see these texts and im  oh no what happened but i also think ive got a job to do so i go online i start reading about it i dont want to watch the footage but ill read about what happened and i think how can i make someone laugh today and then i think i got it i go back on twitter and i tweet guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed especially the finish line and again i think nailed it usa usa but then my phone starts to ring and its my boss or should i say my former boss and they say anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today youre also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or youre fired and i say go fuck yourselves and i meant it i didnt get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because im dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said sure they said well anthony you dont understand you dont understand at all if you dont take this joke down right now if you dont delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people theyre also out of a job and im ashamed to tell you this im embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke cause im happy to fight for what i believe in im happy to take the consequences for what ive done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet couldnt do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now ill tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in im just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture theyre  anthony were family why are you so upset cant you see we did you a favor dont you worry about your career let me ask you san francisco do i seem  i worry about my career no  why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if theyre worried about their money they wouldnt have played the lottery in the first fuckin place i do not worry about my career and they said anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems  youre making fun of the victims and thats wrong but thats not what im doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell me im wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking hey are we trending no this is who im making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston do  what thats worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying dont forget about me today dont forget about me lots of crazy distractions in the news but dont forget how sad i am those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of theyre  a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understand now im sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it its fine its embarrassing but its fun you can laugh at yourself its not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me thats fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess thats what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called shark party all right now some of you enjoyed it but if youve never seen shark party you can never see shark party its been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year  million sharks are killed by human beings every year   people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack im  fuck yeah win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say  what i want to have a shark party as soon as theres a shark attack were having a shark party and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do ive already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark its time for a shark party lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing ive ever said on television smile you son of a bitch shark party and in america where im famous for those types of shenanigans everybody was  anthony that was fucked up it was fucked up to see you dance end of controversy however in new zealand where they dont get my show theyve never seen me and frankly they dont get out much the new zealand media takes the video and they show it to the guys family and they say what do you guys think about this and they say crikey or whatever the fuck they say over there the point is all of new zealand all of new zealand rises up against me all  of those cunts rise up and start threatening my life now i dont read the things that people write about me on the internet but i pay people who do and they come to me and theyre  weve got some terrible news please sit down they say you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of shark party and i was  really new zealand wants to kill me thats weird because they didnt even kill the shark i said how many death threats am i getting and they were  oh all of them you are getting all of the death threats what do you want us to do we can send someone to talk to them extra security what do you want i said no forget about it leave it alone dont worry this might be hard for some to understand ive said it several times tonight everyone is going to die i know full well i am going to die and most of us dont get to choose how we check out but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes best case scenario if somebody murders me over one of my jokes i immediately become a legend im a comedy god the mount rushmore of comedy is me four times i said come on then my security guys are   anthony well just so  that is the dumbest thing weve ever heard but youre the boss  and they leave and then the next day they come back and they say anthony sorry to bother you again i know you didnt care yesterday but its gotten much worse youre gonna wanna hear this they say someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dads phone number and address in pittsburgh posted that online and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand and i have to admit that had never occurred to me before it never crossed my mind that my family my loved ones would ever pay the price be caught in harms way for something ive done or ive joked about and honestly i would cut my throat for my jokes i would give my life for what i do but if anyone and i mean this for a fact if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke ive made even better this man is fantastici watched the show  times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable  great material so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is  but a joke about a famous musicians son falling to his death isnt  where are your

ladies and gentlemen make some noise for ronny chieng     thank you thank you hawaii im turning  so im harvesting my wifes eggs this year im harvesting my wifes eggs so that we can make embryos so we can freeze the embryos so that we do not have to have kids right now because kids are what you have when youve given up on your own hopes and dreams  im still trying here i look at my friends who are my age who have kids and they all look  shit  its gotten to the point where i cant even take a photo with them and post it on my main grid because it messes up the aesthetics of my instagram too much with their fucking haggard faces just drooping wrinkly crowsfeetembedded heads receding hairlines just withering graying hair coming out in clumps because of their children  i did a show and someone i went to high school with in singapore came to the show and after the show i met up with them and they brought another person with them and i was  oh is this other person your mom thank you so much for bringing your mother to my show and that other person was also someone i went to high school with  thats how fucking ugly  these people have become because of their children just unrecognizable so im trying to use money and science to push the curve back a little bit and  first step of harvesting my wifes eggs is i have to inject my wife twice a day for two weeks so i have to inject my wife i am the one injecting my wife twice a day for two weeks zero medical training i was given no medical training whatsoever the government lets you do this the the doctor asked me to do it the doctor was  hey have you ever held a needle before no perfect here take this and inject your wife in the middle of her body  nicolas cage in the rock  twice a day for two weeks with chemicals that we mail to you mystery chemicals that we send to your house in unmarked brown boxes just trust us that its the right thing that youre injecting into the person you love the most internet chemicals that show up it comes in a powder i have to make it into a liquid you understand its a meth lab in my kitchen as im mixing the comp im sweating the whole time cause im scared ill fuck up the measurements and kill my wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely then you have to  the air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements and then you have to put it in the syringe then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude   what youre doing   i dont know what im doing i saw someone do this on doogie howser   i dont even know the angle to put it into her   it looks so painful going in  i love my wife so much i cant even bear to watch her in pain i couldnt even bear to watch the needle go into her i had to inject my wife  this i had to  cover my eyes and  backhand it  into her  kurosawa  did i get the middle of your body no  just walk into the needle  im supposed to do all the work here meet me halfway and  the doctor said if you do everything right if you measure correctly you inject at the right times they scan  this part of her body  that chicago bulls logo right and they were   if you do everything right based on what we can tell you should expect  eggs  and my wife ended up getting   yeah always a  yeah always  a late halfhearted response to  usually the women in the crowd are  whoo yeah all the men in the crowd are always   is that a good number is  a good number of eggs how many eggs equal one bebe is it four eggs is one bebe so  eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together let me put this in a language that men can understand  twentysix eggs from one vagina in one cycle is mvp numbers  twentysix eggs is  if magic johnson averaged the tripledouble and killed his own aids   thats the level of medical miracle thats happening in whatever this part of my wifes body that horn of the bull that  curls into itself the doctor  scraped out  eggs out of my wifes vagina  salmon roe just scooping out just dripping out and then you put it in some nigiri right and then you eat it thats how babies are made you gotta salt bae the eggs onto the ikura and then you eat it so  were trying to make embryos so eggs thats just half the equation i dont know if  how embryos are made but eggs thats just half of it she did her part admirably so now i have to contribute my half of the embryo equation so im sitting in the doctors office   a wet pigeon all right and the doctor comes over and the doctors a woman because of course she is shes  good morning mr chieng so  whens the last time you ejaculated my wife is right here and shes  yeah when is the last time you ejaculated  we would all  to know its the one time in life where youre not allowed to lie about jerking off its when a medical professional is asking you a direct question and its for reproduction its for the intended purpose so you gotta tell the truth so im  whatever ill tell the truth  let me check my calendar   i guess the last time i ejaculated was  let me see  yesterday around  pm  and my wife is  yesterday i was with you all day  and i was  yeah but remember when you took out the trash   because i also put up mvp numbers against a shot clock and heavy defensive pressure but i was thinking of you the whole time its really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever vietnamese people eat my wife is vietnamese ive no idea what the fuck she eats n\\u01b0\\u1edbc m\\u1eafm  and i went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off its the medical jerkingoff room every hospital has a medical jerkingoff room  its nondescript not a lot of signage smaller than i think it should be lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt and im sitting in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and theres grown men outside the door waiting for me to finish  so they too can use the medical jerkingoff room that we are sharing  a wework  and im in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and i couldnt go  sorry sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand im sorry sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me sorry sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters as they code to death painfully and the families crying in the waiting room wasnt turning me on  so i couldnt go i couldnt go so i just call  right im    im  these people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room  i call the doctor back in and im  doc i cant go  i cant medically ejaculate under these circumstances the vibes are off let me go home let me go home to medically ejaculate can i do that and the doctors  yeah you can go home but  as soon as it comes out of your body it expires quicker than avocados in hawaii  youve got  you have  a  window before theres  an exponential decreasing probability of  im   fine ill go home ill medically ejaculate ill come back in  minutes no problem so i go home open the front door ejaculate immediately  this is   this is home court advantage i know where everything is i know whats behind me i look at the dripping garbage bag  its  a pavlovian response at this point  i ejaculate into a cup  its a cup that they gave me its not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen  that says worlds best dad on it  its the cup that they use doctors give you to test your pee for drugs its got a really tight cap right so i ejaculate into the cup it keeps overflowing so i gotta keep  pouring it out  just overwhelming amounts  its  ghostbusters  up in here   i fill it to the brim and then i scrape off the top and then i and then i seal the cap as tight as i can right get it really nice and tight and then i i put it inside my tshirt next to my skin under my armpit nice and snug because the doctor told me to do that because apparently  the titanic your body heat will keep your people alive and then i run downstairs and i jump into a new york city taxi and im  take me to langone hospital please hurry up the taxi driver is  what the fuck are you doing with your hand are you  im  oh yeah no im fine no its not me its my my wife shes wait a person its my jizz  and new york city taxis have seen much worse so the taxi driver was  oh  cool thank you for using a cup  unlike the last two dudes who were back there just raw dogging at the jfk  what im saying and  we get to the we get to the hospital right i open the taxi door i run into the hospital and because its new york city someone on the sidewalk is  hey yo hey yo were you that guy in shangchi  am i yes i was a minor character in the marvel movie shangchi not the main guy and the guys  yo yo can i get a photo with you and im   sure  so we take a photo  this so someone on the internet has a photo of me and this stranger and im doing this  napoleon if you ever come across this photo just know i am holding my own jizz  so feel free to tag it  he was very grateful he was  aw thanks so much man and i was  no problem man i shake his hand right  because i love meeting my fans and i run into the hospital right already hitting the  mark end of the fourth quarter theres no time left on the clock so i just take my jizz and i just throw a buzzerbeater right the doctor  catches my jizz    odell beckham she just  one hand grabs it and  in the same motion without even putting it down she  alleyoops my jizz into my wifes eggs right just takes it and she goes boom shakalaka and  my sperm goes into my wifes eggs and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg nobody knows its a mystery its a mystery of the universe nobody knows when sperm goes into the egg its unknowable ooh its its  the event horizon on a black hole no one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes nothing happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes it becomes a bubble tea  nobody knows where bubble tea comes from its tapioca the sperm goes into the egg and then you shake it and you go to vegas you throw it on the crap table and if youre lucky if you get a good dice roll right it becomes a blastocyst thats what we call future humans blastocysts it becomes embryos the doctor shell take all the embryos and shell look at them under the microscope and shell grade the embryos  cocaine  shell be  ooh yeah these ones these are agrade embryos right here   these ones these are these are bgrade embryos so so i dont know  these these ones these are cgrade embryos  oh and these ones yeah these these are these are dgrade embryos yeah these these will storm the capitol someday  so  you dont want that and then  and then you have to  draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics and you dont know youre just projecting data you just hope youre not throwing away a tom brady in the  round thats going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you cant measure the human spirit and  we all  to think were good people in this room but were all picking the agrade embryos  no one here is not picking your agrade embryos if given a choice even if you were a bgrade embryo  you would still pick your agrade embryos because youll be  i know what its  im not putting my kids through this bgrade human existence with sweaty palms and sciatica  give me the agrade shit give me the best we could do give my kid a fighting chance and it got me thinking about the future a little bit because i never wanted kids i never thought i would have kids the only thing i ever wanted to do my whole life was this standup comedy in america  its the best look at this its the best you are cheering because  this is way better than having kids   so much more fun and lucrative well the blastocysts are real now theres eight of them waiting for me in the cloud   chance of successful implantation with gradea embryos so i guess that makes me a mass murderer in alabama it got me thinking about the future what kind of parent am i gonna be am i gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were or am i gonna be better than my parents were be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck youre supposed to be now and thinking about it turns out im gonna be just as bad as my parents were i can i can feel it i can feel it inside me i can feel the i can feel the chinese inside me i can just feel that high expectation just low tolerance for excuses its in here its right in here its  the default app  you cant delete the calculator app theres no x when you shake it theres no x you can move it off the home screen but its still in the os embedded  in the operating system i can feel the chinese if my blastocyst was real if it entered this reality and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever oh my god look at this blastocyst everybody look look at how beautiful this blastocyst is i love you so much blastocyst i love you much more than i thought i would  and your blastocyst is hugging you back right theyre   i love you too daddy daddy daddy when i grow up i want to be a standup comedian just  you  i just feel the chinese coming on right i just  you take your glasses off  hitler in the bunker  standup comedy are you out of your fucking mind  thats not even a real job what do you think is gonna happen just gonna run around america and tell jokes to strangers who dont give a fuck about your mental health and even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds and make it to even a semiprofessional level as a standup comedian do you think theres any chance in hell youll be funnier than me    dad is a borderline arena act in some markets have you seen my imdb page im in everything i will fucking crush your career osoto gari your mother and i just spent a fortune to make an agrade blastocyst for them to become a bgrade comedian i will never watch anything you do go to law school   is what my father said to me  i do think its tough for straight men in  to sincerely look up selfimprovement on the internet without five weeks later storming the capitol  that mens selfhelp youtube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now  im not saying its the biggest problem in the world clearly but it is a problem  because men were genetically predisposed to seek selfimprovement  were trying to be better people every day believe it or not women  once we hit a certain age  usually we die before then through suicide or environmental factors bmx biking dietary choices but if you can live long enough as a man you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective  you start seeking guidance from outside sources you start looking at watches   every man in this room has or will at some point weve all been there guys weve all done this weve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives and weve been  what a fucking piece of shit  i fucking hate this loser look at this loser fuck this loser i hate this person i need to be a better person let me start by getting fit   let me work on my health that seems  a logical place to start my journey let me control what i can control in here so what do you do as a man you go on youtube right you look up how to lift weights right you press enter you click on the first video its some guy doing kettlebell swings right hell teach you how to lock your core so you dont break your fucking spine and then you do that for two days you feel pretty good about yourself  whoo right and on the third day the same youtube channel has a new video notification alert the men are  whats this new video from kettlebellswinging guy what could he be doing in his new video in the video the kettlebellswinging guy hes doing the new kettlebell exercise the lawnmower hes doing that and then   seconds into the video he just suddenly just stops and he looks really sad and he puts the kettlebell down and he looks straight into the camera and hes  yo guys just real talk for a second all right  kettlebells are great but i just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind  and all the men watching this are  yeah  yeah that makes sense that feels right in here tell me more kettlebellswinging guy  what other advice do you have for all areas of my life including my relationships and financial investments please give me guidance kettlebellswinging guy so what do you do you watch his next video on autoplay then you watch his next video here comes the youtube algorithm with a suggested video and here comes another suggested video and a week later jordan peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men  five weeks later youre storming the capitol dressed  a buffalo    thats a very realistic sequence of events by the way thats not even an exaggerated timeline every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm we all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that mens selfhelp andrew tate masculinity youtube selfhelp algorithm if you dont know anyone who lost their mind  youre the one who lost their mind youre currently in an echo chamber of assholes cause real friends tell you when youre losing your mind its very tragic all these men who are trying to be better people and theyre seeking guidance but that youtube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves theres tragedy in that  all those people they were just trying to lift weights  they werent trying to cause an insurrection they didnt even know what that word meant they were just trying to do this theyre trying to do this they didnt know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis\\u00e0vis their torso right is it  degrees or  degrees  is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you they googled it one time and then five weeks later youre taking a shit on nancy pelosis desk  and the us marshals are garnishing your wages because you take one wrong turn and life moves pretty quick im not saying as a man dont take responsibility for your own actions  im just saying that youtube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys it it sucks men in in a way that i dont think women understand it really preys on that mens need to seek guidance from somewhere its very hard to resist it just draws draws you in thats why fucking mark zuckerberg is trying to mma fight elon musk right now  that guy fell for his own algorithm do you understand mark zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd and for   years now hes just been looking at our data right jerking off every single day just looking at our data jerking off money piling up billions of dollars data jerking off money money jerking off data for  years that loop and who knew after two decades of that one day he just looked at so much data he was  oh shit oh shit he fell into it now hes trying to mmafight elon musk that guy jerked off and came on his own face   its out of control zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality and he invented that shit and he still fell for it what hope does the average man in america have just walking just waddling down the street looking looking for a taco on his phone hes gonna get sucked into his phone he has no chance that fucking guy has no chance because even the good guys in this room were all  on a razors edge to being a piece of shit   that margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razorthin i gotta tell you if you have the means every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge and  what an instagram post could push it either way   it depends on the post was it cute animals or was it boobs  thats gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours i do think as a society we need to  do a better job of identifying  when we have a disagreement with someone whos genuinely trying to have a goodfaith discussion to reach higher understanding and whos just talking shit we are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit and were not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics  for example me right now im just talking shit   this is oneway shittalking i dont care about any of your opinions do not send me any of them i do not care you paid for me i didnt pay a cent for any of you    free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shittalking session if you dont  it take it out on adam smith but if i was having a conversation with someone i disagree with in good faith i would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with thatd be a logical place to start a difficult conversation for example maga make america great again they have a point americas not doing so great right now right our kids math scores are down  our childrens science scores are down when judged according to international metrics  healthcare systems not doing so great wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially there was an implied promise to a generation of americans that if you do certain things work hard go to college be a good person you would have certain outcomes and those outcomes didnt materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decisionmaking positions lowered the capital gains tax  so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year in postworld war ii us leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for national security by making the us dollar the default international trade currency which gave america the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a us financial banking system but consequently increased the value of the us dollar astronomically which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in america  although the logic at the time  was that americans were supposed to upskill en masse away from the menial manufacturing jobs but everyone heres too much of a dumbass to stay school so we just traded domestic manufacturing to asia and the rest of the world at the expense of workingclass families but if you dont read enough  it comes out as lets go brandon  and its  you have a point but you dont have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didnt read enough you gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag theres a book behind the word you gotta keep going you can go at your own pace but you gotta finish the required reading otherwise we cant have a conversation were all catching up to each other im friends with maga im friends with the magas some of them are my good friends  whoo yeah hawaii maga  the friendliest of all maga  aloha maga theyre in hawaii right now making aloha great again i became friends with them because i filmed two seasons of a tv show in hawaii doogie kame\\u0101loha on disney   maga hawaii welcomed me into their homes ronny please come over please were having a barbecue wed love you to meet the family meet the ohana please wed love to have you over so gracious you show up theyre so warm and welcoming thanks for coming take whatever you want theres some kalua pork theres some loco mocos hot dogs hey here here touch my gun  touch it just touch just take it im always  i i dont want to touch any of these guns  i dont know where theyve been i dont know where theyre going i dont have time in my schedule to attend depositions  just give me the loco moco  very passionate people my maga friends and i respect their passion to some extent i do theyre  i love america i would die for this country and i believe them i believe they love america and i believe they would die for this country which is very admirable but its  man you are willing to die for your country why arent you willing to learn math  also for your country   do both for your country i know you wanna die for your country but were losing the engineering jobs to asia right now so if you we need less people to die for their country we need more people to do their homework for their country  do your homework for your country  actually sit down and show the work and  do the thats a more efficient way to show your patriotism if you take that i want to die energy and you put it into homework you will fucking top the school im telling you its skys the limit  dude youll youll solve a lot of problems youll create a lot of jobs youll increase the gdp just do do your homework for your country id rather die  i i thought so i thought that might be i thought that might be the case dyings easy math is hard  these quadratic equations making me suicidal  we try not to talk about politics my maga friends and i out of mutual respect inevitably it comes up some stuff im wrong about some stuff theyre right about but sometimes  their messaging is so convoluted  i cant get to what their core issue actually is because their surface messaging is so chaotic  sometimes theyre  ronny china caused covid but covid isnt real  so is it fine then does it mean its fine i dont know how to feel about it now cause one minus one is zero i dont know what to tell you the the math analogy works for concepts not just numbers you can x is anything why are you yelling at me about china always yelling at me about china china is doing this china did a weather balloon with a camera chinas got an artificial island in the pacific doubling as an aircraft carrier base chinas doing tiktok why is

thats us  my my maga friends all hate us tax thats  a universal party platform theres different types of maga right theres  maga light maga concentrated but  right its unfair to group them under one banner but one uniting party principle is love america fuck us tax and i get it i also hate us tax now that im in the highest bracket  yeah im maga with that fuck us tax yeah fuck american tax feels good to say it  the words give you power right fuck us tax fuck american tax you  it you  it when i say it when this fucking foreigner says it you  that fuck us tax you  that you  it when this accent

consider this concept in a vacuum just as an academic exercise  when you love something you give it money  right  thats one of the primary ways we show love for individuals organizations ideas on

every once in a while probably tore stuff giving birth to you cut her a piece of the pie arbitrarily even just give a im sure your mother would appreciate it no matter who your mom is how selfaccomplished she is im sure your mom could use it fix the driveway invest in infrastructure something  sometimes americans treat their country the way they treat their parents  yeah  i love my mom i love my mom i would die for my mom but fuck her she made her choices  i love being in america i do i love being here i had my options i came here i love being in america because this is the country that puts show business above everything and i am in the business of show business so naturally im gonna come here and do it i do this in america fuck america fuck the president fuck us tax money money just comes into  fuck the president hes too old fuck this president the money comes in money just comes in  printing money i do this in malaysia same same words same same clothing same haircut facing the same direction in malaysia jail   the arbitrage value is out of control same product in different loc obviously ill do this here why the fuck would i do it anywhere else its the best i

disrespectful and they forget  im also an immigrant theyll be   my parents theyre immigrants  immigrants theyre so cheap   dont come over my familys over this weekend my parents are here my parents

believing everything they see on the internet i get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last due to the exponential technology growth curve  but this has got to be the biggest gap in human history the information asymmetry right now is just out of control you literally have people in honolulu right now autodriving their tesla cybertrucks as they vape out the window and their phone ai is trading cryptocurrency meanwhile you have baby boomers they cant even rightclick  they cant even rightclick theres one button

how did  that because the font the font is off and the resolution of the image is blurry and that lighting state doesnt make sense for that image and thats not standard dimensions for a news article i cant give you this knowledge its  malcolm gladwells blink ive seen so much shit on the internet my brain instantly filters it youll never have this skill set so just stay off the internet this world is not for you anymore stop making decisions  but anyway respect your elders  its a confucian value maybe if you give your mom some money she wouldnt get scammed so much yeah well think about the correlation between those two phenomena  people always ask me  why do you shit on your mom for money why dont you shit on your dad for money    no i dont talk about my dad because  my dad has no context for show business  we grew up in malaysia  his families are rubber tappers in malaysia my aunts and uncles are still in sitiawan in malaysia right now tapping rubber they have no context for show business very smart people but they dont know this world my dad he was the first guy in his family to get a college education he went to manchester college which has merged with the university of southern new hampshire he got his masters of economics there put himself through it very smart guy and he was a good immigrant he came to america to new hampshire to get his education and when he graduated he went back to malaysia he didnt take anyones job he left  and my dad had the vision to see what i didnt see he knew he had a ceiling on him because of the way he thinks and talks and he went back to malaysia and he was right for him he went back it was the right choice for him he became a very successful corporate executive  he retired to a farm in johor bahru malaysia love farming he retired to a farm thats how much this guy loved it but he had no context for show business so he wouldnt understand anything im doing  he wouldnt understand what im doing in godzilla vs kong hed be  why dont you just run that way  dad i dont control the edit  im just honolulu chinatown shopkeeper no  in this in this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla  im just connecting act  to act  i dont have a say in how this plays out because of that i stopped telling him about what i was doing i felt he wouldnt get it and he stopped asking me so i didnt tell him i got hired on the daily show he found out the way all parents find out about their kids accolades through a local newspaper so one day the local paper reported that i got hired on the daily show and he called me immediately he was  ronny whats this i hear about you joining the everyday show and i was  oh no its the daily show i joined  two years ago dad he was  oh  well whats the daily show im  its just  another latenight american talk show they kind of invented modern american satire and  and  my dad was  oh thats cool are you the host im  no im a correspondent he was  what is that whats a correspondent im  yeah correspondent is i help the host with comedy segments and he was  oh  hey mei hes just a sidekick  and so he had  no context for what was a win what was a milestone in this industry and so i stopped telling him and he stopped asking me and i didnt need that from him we we were totally fine wed talk about other stuff not about work we werent fighting it was all good  and he passed away very suddenly  in  he died on christmas eve died on his farm  no warning no explanation he just left one day he left so suddenly we had to go back to handle his estate if anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position when you have to handle someone elses estate it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life and so its me my wife my sister brotherinlaw went back to johor bahru and part of me trying to figure out his estate was i had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using so his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it and i opened it up and its passwordprotected and i know this guy so well im  his password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child so  i type in my sisters birthday and spot on spot on it was my sisters birthday  as it should be shes  an anesthesiologist in australia shes  way more respectable person than me actually saving lives  a good person contributing back to society not  this fucking asshole i get in  i get in trouble on the internet for shit i said two years ago every six weeks so it should be her she should be the favorite so i log into his computer i open his web browser i look at his browsing history and the whole time im  please dont let me find my dads porn please dont let me find what positions my dad was into even if it was just missionary i wouldnt be able to handle it im gonna have to burn this laptop for real chinese people when we burn things it goes to our ancestors and then my granddad is gonna see it and its  i dont i dont want that for them ill be fine but theyre gonna have an awkward time im considerate  that  so i open the web browser look at his history and way to go dad no porn what a cleancut guy no porn he only went on the internet twice a day  clockwork  am and  pm  the farmer that he was and every time he went on the internet hed only go to two websites each time so the first website hed go to was a local news website and the second website hed go to twice a day every single day was my twitter page  aw so hed be reloading my twitter page twice a day just to see what i was doing and i post stuff  hey honolulu hawaii i sold out five shows  this week whys there so many homeless people here id post stuff  that  and  he would read that and then hed be  i assume hed be  oh ronnys doing  hes in hawaii he sold out some shows and oh i guess theres a lot of homeless people in hawaii  and  that was his quiet way of keeping up with me he never told me that and i never knew that and we never discussed it  which is a very nice sentiment unfortunately  as best as i can tell this is the last tweet my dad read of mine  so as best as i can tell forensically based on internet browsing timestamps the last tweet my dad read of mine and quite possibly the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm was me posting on twitter if youre a baby boomer on twitter i already know youre a fucking loser  now obviously this was not directed towards him i didnt even know he had twitter i didnt even know he knew what twitter was but i stand by the statement   and i know thats kind of a weird way to end the show but    if its any solace  this was his phone when he died  aw that was his  wallpaper and his screensaver and  and i didnt even know and its a photo of me and my wife and were in hawaii and im wearing two leis cause my mom threw one off and i put it on  and  i didnt know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper  and   i i  to i  to think that  that is the last image he saw of me thats what he remembered me by when he left and  i also would  to tell my sister i won  i won it was me it was me you guys have been great

to get this shit over with cause i have to pee in  ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for coming  its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that  i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat  shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through and then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its  to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find out  i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books  fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was  the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost   and everybody thought it was  this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was  the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was  you never know when you might need this and i was  but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success i grew up a lot this past year  this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and  hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was  oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was  oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was  all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had  we had we had so much chemistry he was  hey wassup i was  wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was  hey can you drop me off i was  where he was  at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was  oh no i just fucked a homeless dude again my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who   wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they  to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it  because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude  you feel  youre in a wes anderson movie or something and  white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff  voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff  that and its very  its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel  im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement  just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im  i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer  but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you  you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on  my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was  hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its  making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just  a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night  oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre  i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more  loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell  responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding  between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things  host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse   learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up  filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was  its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was  its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total  private school asians we both are big hippies too we  to backpack through southeast asia we  to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit  that  we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes  freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats  a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel  we are white people doing an impression of asian people  we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were  oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so  i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because  that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre  im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is  shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always  oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013  you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and  very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be  were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be  we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre  but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do  how much shittier food tastes when  you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be  look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im  that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retired i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day  youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically  wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre  oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks  its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to  squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want  its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was  you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently  and he was  hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was  why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes  mrs pacman just lets redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was   youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really  freaked out about anal and theyre  oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel  youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt  i got a second chance at life  i was  oh my god its  im going back in time \\u266a a whole new world \\u266a it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah  a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your\\u2013 just give your man a little\\u2013 a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari  and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont\\u2013 no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they  it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i  that fear that shit turns me on  especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye  hes discovered nirvana and its  youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim  my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when\\u2013 when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right  i respect you right im  yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who  to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their\\u2013 glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control   i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live  i just wanna be out of control for once just\\u2013 just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cunt im just waiting for the right moment to  become a housewife financially  i want my husband to get us to  a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people thats the kind of income bracket im striving for thats when  youve made it when youre eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple  what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking  a princess i have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be  guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are  thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me  a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were  ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was  yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won  another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were  why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was  yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed  a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and  why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were  yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im  oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here  i need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre  im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are  the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because  im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me  im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbusters i dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b  skittles so my uterus probably looked  a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act  everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich  mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were  oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was  only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be  were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its  release the kraken and they just come out  a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship  and  yeah and most of the time  we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be  ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look  they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be  hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymore im very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre  oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was   yeah where im from thats  losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was  no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was  yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was  you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted im scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula  what that is  what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did  that youre gonna poop on the table i was  yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense  that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channel i can already see how theres  this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommy  i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i  i berate my husband on  a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant  your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see  a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then  they get big\\u2013 they get big  fingers  you you you owe me money you my nipples look  whoppers now and naked i look  a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not  when i was  years old when it was  really hot  and i was  why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporin so  i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos  way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and  two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnant all right ive been ali wong have a good night everybody thank you your email address will not

see everything around it for up to ten seconds after its decapitated yeah yeah i never know what to say i never know what to say to someone after theyve lost a baby what do you say to someone after theyve lost a baby oh im sorry for your loss doesnt cut it are you gonna be  not even close thats why i just keep my mouth shut let my lawyer do the talking im not good with kids thats my point thats what this whole things about im not good with kids not gonna lie hell a couple of months ago i dropped my cousins baby flatout dropped my cousins baby on the ground but i dont feel  that was my fault i dont feel responsible for that one  who in their right mind who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me anthony jeselnik to be a pallbearer its  people hate people hate dead baby jokes they hate them they hate them its  anthony why do you have to tell dead baby jokes why do you have so many dead baby jokes no one likes them why do you insist well ill tell you why because dead baby jokes have made me rich and who was it who was it who said the first million is the hardest was it hitler didnt see that one coming did you that was a good response most audiences just pretend i didnt say it but i  it i  making hitler jokes its cool for me i enjoy it hell i lost my grandfather i lost my grandfather in the holocaust museum it was the holocaust museum of modern art which is just  a normal holocaust museum except you walk around all day being  oh i should have thought of that my grandmother died about a year ago and i didnt think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away but i was wrong it was fine the hard part the upsetting part was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted she wanted to die in the best way possible   you radio winner whats the best way you can die this is not a trick question \\u2013 in your sleep \\u2013 yes thank you thank you everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep not me i want to be alert awake surrounded by friends in a house fire but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep we thought thats how she went we were all excited for her but then we did an autopsy found out she actually died horribly in the worst way possible during an autopsy it was fucked up yeah yeah she always said her grandkids didnt pay enough attention to her and and she was right she was dead on but i loved my grandma loved her very much my grandma taught me about a lot taught me what religion is taught me everything you can know about religion in one quick story ill tell you now when i graduated from high school when i graduated my grandma came to me gave me a big hug said anthony im so proud of you youre my first grandchild to get to go to college what can i do for you what can i give you before you go to college and i said honestly grandma all i need from you is money yeah i know you guys have never been but college is expensive and my grandma said  anthony i understand couple months go by its the end of summer im packing up my dads car getting ready to go to school and my grandma walks up says anthony here before you leave take this and she handed me a brandnew bible king james version and i said thanks grandma thats exactly what we talked about i got in the car and i went off to school couple of weeks go by im hanging out in my dorm room having a good time when the phone rings its my grandma anthony just calling to see how college is going grandma college is the best im having the time of my life but to be honest im starting to run low on money and i could use a little bit  we talked about she said  well let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said totally grandma im on chapter four she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later hung up the phone couple of months go by now im really starting to struggle financially might have to drop out of school so i call my grandma in a panic i say please its anthony im having the time of my life in college but if i wanna graduate and i do i need you to send me some money  we talked about she said anthony let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said yes grandma i wish it was longer and she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later finally its the end of the school year ive got straight as but im dropping out of college cause i have no more money left and im furious close to tears cleaning out my dorm room when the phone rings its my grandma anthony i heard youre dropping out of school today how come and i said  goddamn well how come grandma cause you wouldnt give me any money she said anthony let me ask you this did you read your bible and i just hung up the phone i was so pissed off took everything out of that room last thing i took off the shelf the last thing i took out of that room was that bible my grandma had given me took it off the shelf held it in my hands and for the first time i actually opened it up and on the very first page in my grandmothers handwriting it said fuck you thank you everyone i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight and all the jokes i write theyre all made up theyre all fake except for eric clapton and the challenger everything else everything else is fake but everything im about to tell you from here until the end of the show thats all true now i dont tell dark jokes because im a comedian im a comedian because i tell dark jokes im kind of fucked up all right ive always been this way i cant really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends its ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyones funeral i asked a friend for advice was  ive never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and dont tell a joke try not to so i walked up and was   what my favorite memory was when i was  four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it  mark twain out of my grandmas mouth it would just come to life and then i couldnt help myself i said and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the n word now i promise you i promise you until youve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wifes funeral at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think im one of the best comedians of all time but heres the thing it doesnt matter if you believe me it really doesnt matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i  to test myself i  to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i  to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i dont believe in too soon im on a tight schedule and im good at it im good at it  the day of the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted other than that how was the movie right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that the reason i get away with stuff  that is im just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didnt make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i dont follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying dont do it and whenever i see that whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad cause i know something horrible has happened people will say anthony whats funny about aurora whats funny about the boston marathon whats funny about your grandmothers funeral nothing nothing is funny about those things thats where i come in so i see these texts and im  oh no what happened but i also think ive got a job to do so i go online i start reading about it i dont want to watch the footage but ill read about what happened and i think how can i make someone laugh today and then i think i got it i go back on twitter and i tweet guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed especially the finish line and again i think nailed it usa usa but then my phone starts to ring and its my boss or should i say my former boss and they say anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today youre also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or youre fired and i say go fuck yourselves and i meant it i didnt get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because im dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said sure they said well anthony you dont understand you dont understand at all if you dont take this joke down right now if you dont delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people theyre also out of a job and im ashamed to tell you this im embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke cause im happy to fight for what i believe in im happy to take the consequences for what ive done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet couldnt do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now ill tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in im just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture theyre  anthony were family why are you so upset cant you see we did you a favor dont you worry about your career let me ask you san francisco do i seem  i worry about my career no  why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if theyre worried about their money they wouldnt have played the lottery in the first fuckin place i do not worry about my career and they said anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems  youre making fun of the victims and thats wrong but thats not what im doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell me im wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking hey are we trending no this is who im making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston do  what thats worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying dont forget about me today dont forget about me lots of crazy distractions in the news but dont forget how sad i am those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of theyre  a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understand now im sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it its fine its embarrassing but its fun you can laugh at yourself its not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me thats fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess thats what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called shark party all right now some of you enjoyed it but if youve never seen shark party you can never see shark party its been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year  million sharks are killed by human beings every year   people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack im  fuck yeah win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say  what i want to have a shark party as soon as theres a shark attack were having a shark party and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do ive already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark its time for a shark party lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing ive ever said on television smile you son of a bitch shark party and in america where im famous for those types of shenanigans everybody was  anthony that was fucked up it was fucked up to see you dance end of controversy however in new zealand where they dont get my show theyve never seen me and frankly they dont get out much the new zealand media takes the video and they show it to the guys family and they say what do you guys think about this and they say crikey or whatever the fuck they say over there the point is all of new zealand all of new zealand rises up against me all  of those cunts rise up and start threatening my life now i dont read the things that people write about me on the internet but i pay people who do and they come to me and theyre  weve got some terrible news please sit down they say you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of shark party and i was  really new zealand wants to kill me thats weird because they didnt even kill the shark i said how many death threats am i getting and they were  oh all of them you are getting all of the death threats what do you want us to do we can send someone to talk to them extra security what do you want i said no forget about it leave it alone dont worry this might be hard for some to understand ive said it several times tonight everyone is going to die i know full well i am going to die and most of us dont get to choose how we check out but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes best case scenario if somebody murders me over one of my jokes i immediately become a legend im a comedy god the mount rushmore of comedy is me four times i said come on then my security guys are   anthony well just so  that is the dumbest thing weve ever heard but youre the boss  and they leave and then the next day they come back and they say anthony sorry to bother you again i know you didnt care yesterday but its gotten much worse youre gonna wanna hear this they say someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dads phone number and address in pittsburgh posted that online and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand and i have to admit that had never occurred to me before it never crossed my mind that my family my loved ones would ever pay the price be caught in harms way for something ive done or ive joked about and honestly i would cut my throat for my jokes i would give my life for what i do but if anyone and i mean this for a fact if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke ive made even better this man is fantastici watched the show  times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable  great material so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is  but a joke about a famous musicians son falling to his death isnt  where are your

without even putting it down she  alleyoops my jizz into my wifes eggs right just takes it and she goes boom shakalaka and  my sperm goes into my wifes eggs and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg nobody knows its a mystery its a mystery of the universe nobody knows when sperm goes into the egg its unknowable ooh its its  the event horizon on a black hole no one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes nothing happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes it becomes a bubble tea  nobody knows where bubble tea comes from its tapioca the sperm goes into the egg and then you shake it and you go to vegas you throw it on the crap table and if youre lucky if you get a good dice roll right it becomes a blastocyst thats what we call future humans blastocysts it becomes embryos the doctor shell take all the embryos and shell look at them under the microscope and shell grade the embryos  cocaine  shell be  ooh yeah these ones these are agrade embryos right here   these ones these are these are bgrade embryos so so i dont know  these these ones these are cgrade embryos  oh and these ones yeah these these are these are dgrade embryos yeah these these will storm the capitol someday  so  you dont want that and then  and then you have to  draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics and you dont know youre just projecting data you just hope youre not throwing away a tom brady in the  round thats going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you cant measure the human spirit and  we all  to think were good people in this room but were all picking the agrade embryos  no one here is not picking your agrade embryos if given a choice even if you were a bgrade embryo  you would still pick your agrade embryos because youll be  i know what its  im not putting my kids through this bgrade human existence with sweaty palms and sciatica  give me the agrade shit give me the best we could do give my kid a fighting chance and it got me thinking about the future a little bit because i never wanted kids i never thought i would have kids the only thing i ever wanted to do my whole life was this standup comedy in america  its the best look at this its the best you are cheering because  this is way better than having kids   so much more fun and lucrative well the blastocysts are real now theres eight of them waiting for me in the cloud   chance of successful implantation with gradea embryos so i guess that makes me a mass murderer in alabama it got me thinking about the future what kind of parent am i gonna be am i gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were or am i gonna be better than my parents were be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck youre supposed to be now and thinking about it turns out im gonna be just as bad as my parents were i can i can feel it i can feel it inside me i can feel the i can feel the chinese inside me i can just feel that high expectation just low tolerance for excuses its in here its right in here its  the default app  you cant delete the calculator app theres no x when you shake it theres no x you can move it off the home screen but its still in the os embedded  in the operating system i can feel the chinese if my blastocyst was real if it entered this reality and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever oh my god look at this blastocyst everybody look look at how beautiful this blastocyst is i love you so much blastocyst i love you much more than i thought i would  and your blastocyst is hugging you back right theyre   i love you too daddy daddy daddy when i grow up i want to be a standup comedian just  you  i just feel the chinese coming on right i just  you take your glasses off  hitler in the bunker  standup comedy are you out of your fucking mind  thats not even a real job what do you think is gonna happen just gonna run around america and tell jokes to strangers who dont give a fuck about your mental health and even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds and make it to even a semiprofessional level as a standup comedian do you think theres any chance in hell youll be funnier than me    dad is a borderline arena act in some markets have you seen my imdb page im in everything i will fucking crush your career osoto gari your mother and i just spent a fortune to make an agrade blastocyst for them to become a bgrade comedian i will never watch anything you do go to law school   is what my father said to me  i do think its tough for straight men in  to sincerely look up selfimprovement on the internet without five weeks later storming the capitol  that mens selfhelp youtube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now  im not saying its the biggest problem in the world clearly but it is a problem  because men were genetically predisposed to seek selfimprovement  were trying to be better people every day believe it or not women  once we hit a certain age  usually we die before then through suicide or environmental factors bmx biking dietary choices but if you can live long enough as a man you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective  you start seeking guidance from outside sources you start looking at watches   every man in this room has or will at some point weve all been there guys weve all done this weve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives and weve been  what a fucking piece of shit  i fucking hate this loser look at this loser fuck this loser i hate this person i need to be a better person let me start by getting fit   let me work on my health that seems  a logical place to start my journey let me control what i can control in here so what do you do as a man you go on youtube right you look up how to lift weights right you press enter you click on the first video its some guy doing kettlebell swings right hell teach you how to lock your core so you dont break your fucking spine and then you do that for two days you feel pretty good about yourself  whoo right and on the third day the same youtube channel has a new video notification alert the men are  whats this new video from kettlebellswinging guy what could he be doing in his new video in the video the kettlebellswinging guy hes doing the new kettlebell exercise the lawnmower hes doing that and then   seconds into the video he just suddenly just stops and he looks really sad and he puts the kettlebell down and he looks straight into the camera and hes  yo guys just real talk for a second all right  kettlebells are great but i just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind  and all the men watching this are  yeah  yeah that makes sense that feels right in here tell me more kettlebellswinging guy  what other advice do you have for all areas of my life including my relationships and financial investments please give me guidance kettlebellswinging guy so what do you do you watch his next video on autoplay then you watch his next video here comes the youtube algorithm with a suggested video and here comes another suggested video and a week later jordan peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men  five weeks later youre storming the capitol dressed  a buffalo    thats a very realistic sequence of events by the way thats not even an exaggerated timeline every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm we all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that mens selfhelp andrew tate masculinity youtube selfhelp algorithm if you dont know anyone who lost their mind  youre the one who lost their mind youre currently in an echo chamber of assholes cause real friends tell you when youre losing your mind its very tragic all these men who are trying to be better people and theyre seeking guidance but that youtube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves theres tragedy in that  all those people they were just trying to lift weights  they werent trying to cause an insurrection they didnt even know what that word meant they were just trying to do this theyre trying to do this they didnt know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis\\u00e0vis their torso right is it  degrees or  degrees  is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you they googled it one time and then five weeks later youre taking a shit on nancy pelosis desk  and the us marshals are garnishing your wages because you take one wrong turn and life moves pretty quick im not saying as a man dont take responsibility for your own actions  im just saying that youtube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys it it sucks men in in a way that i dont think women understand it really preys on that mens need to seek guidance from somewhere its very hard to resist it just draws draws you in thats why fucking mark zuckerberg is trying to mma fight elon musk right now  that guy fell for his own algorithm do you understand mark zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd and for   years now hes just been looking at our data right jerking off every single day just looking at our data jerking off money piling up billions of dollars data jerking off money money jerking off data for  years that loop and who knew after two decades of that one day he just looked at so much data he was  oh shit oh shit he fell into it now hes trying to mmafight elon musk that guy jerked off and came on his own face   its out of control zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality and he invented that shit and he still fell for it what hope does the average man in america have just walking just waddling down the street looking looking for a taco on his phone hes gonna get sucked into his phone he has no chance that fucking guy has no chance because even the good guys in this room were all  on a razors edge to being a piece of shit   that margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razorthin i gotta tell you if you have the means every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge and  what an instagram post could push it either way   it depends on the post was it cute animals or was it boobs  thats gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours i do think as a society we need to  do a better job of identifying  when we have a disagreement with someone whos genuinely trying to have a goodfaith discussion to reach higher understanding and whos just talking shit we are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit and were not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics  for example me right now im just talking shit   this is oneway shittalking i dont care about any of your opinions do not send me any of them i do not care you paid for me i didnt pay a cent for any of you    free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shittalking session if you dont  it take it out on adam smith but if i was having a conversation with someone i disagree with in good faith i would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with thatd be a logical place to start a difficult conversation for example maga make america great again they have a point americas not doing so great right now right our kids math scores are down  our childrens science scores are down when judged according to international metrics  healthcare systems not doing so great wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially there was an implied promise to a generation of americans that if you do certain things work hard go to college be a good person you would have certain outcomes and those outcomes didnt materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decisionmaking positions lowered the capital gains tax  so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year in postworld war ii us leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for national security by making the us dollar the default international trade currency which gave america the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a us financial banking system but consequently increased the value of the us dollar astronomically which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in america  although the logic at the time  was that americans were supposed to upskill en masse away from the menial manufacturing jobs but everyone heres too much of a dumbass to stay school so we just traded domestic manufacturing to asia and the rest of the world at the expense of workingclass families but if you dont read enough  it comes out as lets go brandon  and its  you have a point but you dont have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didnt read enough you gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag theres a book behind the word you gotta keep going you can go at your own pace but you gotta finish the required reading otherwise we cant have a conversation were all catching up to each other im friends with maga im friends with the magas some of them are my good friends  whoo yeah hawaii maga  the friendliest of all maga  aloha maga theyre in hawaii right now making aloha great again i became friends with them because i filmed two seasons of a tv show in hawaii doogie

the loco moco  very passionate people my maga friends and i respect their passion to some extent i do theyre  i love america i would die for this country and i believe them i believe they love america

country i know you wanna die for your country but were losing the engineering jobs to asia right now so if you we need less people to die for their country we need more people to do their homework for their country  do your homework for your country  actually sit down and show the work and  do the thats a more efficient way to show your patriotism if you take that i want to die energy and you put it into homework you will fucking top the school im telling you its skys the limit  dude youll youll solve a lot of problems youll create a lot of jobs youll increase the gdp just do do your homework for your country id rather die  i i thought so i thought that might be i thought that might be the case dyings easy math is hard  these quadratic equations making me suicidal  we try not to talk about politics my maga friends and i out of mutual respect inevitably it comes up some stuff im wrong about some stuff theyre right about but sometimes  their messaging is so convoluted  i cant get to what their core issue actually is because their surface messaging is so chaotic  sometimes theyre  ronny china caused covid but covid isnt real  so is it fine then does it mean its fine i dont know how to feel about it now cause one minus one is zero i dont know what to tell you the the math analogy works for concepts not just numbers you can x is anything why are you yelling at me about china always

selfaccomplished she is im sure your mom could use it fix the driveway invest in infrastructure something  sometimes americans treat their country the way they treat their parents  yeah  i love my mom i love my mom i would die for my mom but fuck her she made her choices  i love being in america i do i love being here i had my options i came here i love being in america because this is the country

believing everything they see on the internet i get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last due to the exponential technology growth curve  but this has got to be the biggest gap in human history the information asymmetry right now is just out of control you literally have people in honolulu right now autodriving their tesla cybertrucks as they vape out the window and their phone ai is trading cryptocurrency meanwhile you have baby boomers they cant even rightclick  they cant even rightclick theres one button

cant give you this knowledge its  malcolm gladwells blink ive seen so much shit on the internet my brain instantly filters it youll never have this skill set so just stay off the internet this world is not for you anymore stop making decisions  but anyway respect your elders  its a confucian value maybe if you give your mom some money she wouldnt get scammed so much yeah well think about the correlation between those two phenomena  people always ask me  why do you shit on your mom for money why dont you shit on your dad for money    no i dont talk about my dad because  my dad has no context for show business  we grew up in malaysia  his families are rubber tappers in malaysia my aunts and uncles are still in sitiawan in malaysia right now tapping rubber they have no context for show business very smart people but they dont know this world my dad he was the first guy in his family to get a college education he went to manchester college which has merged with the university of southern new hampshire he got his masters of economics there put himself through it very smart guy and he was a good immigrant he came to america to new hampshire to get his education and when he graduated he went back to malaysia he didnt take anyones job he left  and my dad had the vision to see what i didnt see he knew he had a ceiling on him because of the way he thinks and talks and he went back to malaysia and he was right for him he went back it was the right choice for him he became a very successful corporate executive  he retired to a farm in johor bahru malaysia love farming he retired to a farm thats how much this guy loved it but he had no context for show business so he wouldnt understand anything im doing  he wouldnt understand what im doing in godzilla vs kong hed be  why dont you just run that way  dad i dont control the edit  im just honolulu chinatown shopkeeper no  in this in this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla  im just connecting act  to act  i dont have a say in how this plays out because of that i stopped telling him about what i was doing i felt he wouldnt get it and he stopped asking me so i didnt tell him i got hired on the daily show he found out the way all parents find out about their kids accolades through a local newspaper so one day the local paper reported that i got hired on the daily show and he called me immediately he was  ronny whats this i hear about you joining the everyday show and i was  oh no its the daily show i joined  two years ago dad he was  oh  well whats the daily show im  its just  another latenight american talk show they kind of invented modern american satire and  and  my dad was  oh thats cool are you the host im  no im a correspondent he was  what is that whats a correspondent im  yeah correspondent is i help the host with comedy segments and he was  oh  hey mei hes just a sidekick  and so he had  no context for what was a win what was a milestone in this industry and so i stopped telling him and he stopped asking me and i didnt need that from him we we were totally fine wed talk about other stuff not about work we werent fighting it was all good  and he passed away very suddenly  in  he died on christmas eve died on his farm  no warning no explanation he just left one day he left so suddenly we had to go back to handle his estate if anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position when you have to handle someone elses estate it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life and so its me my wife my sister brotherinlaw went back to johor bahru and part of me trying to figure out his estate was i had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using so his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it and i opened it up and its passwordprotected and i know this guy so well im  his password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child so  i type in my sisters birthday and spot on spot on it was my sisters birthday  as it should be shes  an anesthesiologist in australia shes  way more respectable person than me actually saving lives  a good person contributing back to society not  this fucking asshole i get in  i get in trouble on the internet for shit i said two years ago every six weeks so it should be her she should be the favorite so i log into his computer i open his web browser i look at his browsing history and the whole time im  please dont let me find my dads porn please dont let me find what positions my dad was into even if it was just missionary i wouldnt be able to handle it im gonna have to burn this laptop for real chinese people when we burn things it goes to our ancestors and then my granddad is gonna see it and its  i dont i dont want that for them ill be fine but theyre gonna have an awkward time im considerate  that  so i open the web browser look at his history and way to go dad no porn what a cleancut guy no porn he only went on the internet twice a day  clockwork  am and  pm  the farmer that he was and every time he went on the internet hed only go to two websites

baby boomer on twitter i already know youre a fucking loser  now obviously this was not directed towards him i didnt even know he had twitter i didnt even know he knew what twitter was but i stand by the statement   and i know thats kind of a weird way to end the show but    if its any solace  this was his phone when he died  aw that was his  wallpaper and his screensaver and  and i didnt even know and its a photo of me and my wife and were in hawaii and im wearing two leis cause my mom threw one off and i put it on  and  i didnt know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper  and   i

in  ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for coming  its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that  i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat  shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through and then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its  to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find out  i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books  fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was  the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost   and everybody thought it was  this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was  the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was  you never know when you might need this and i was  but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success i grew up a lot this past year  this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and  hes– hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was  oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was  oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was  all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had  we had we had so much chemistry he was  hey wassup i was  wassup and we– the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was  hey can you drop me off i was  where he was  at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was  oh no i just fucked a homeless dude again my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who   wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they  to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it  because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude  you feel  youre in a wes anderson movie or something and  white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff  voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff  that and its very  its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel  im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement  just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im  i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer  but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you  you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on  my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican pe',\n",
              "  'ople all the time and i was  hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its  making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just  a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night  oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre  i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more  loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell  responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding  between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things  host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse   learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up  filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was  its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was  its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total  private school asians we both are big hippies too we  to backpack through southeast asia we  to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit  that  we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes  freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats  a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel  we are white people doing an impression of asian people  we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were  oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i– i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so  i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because  that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre  im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is  shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always  oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you–  you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and  very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be  were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be  we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre  but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free

housewives that well see on the street and theyll be  look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im  that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retired i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office

to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever

              "  'anamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres– none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be  guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are  thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me  a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were  ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become– youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was  yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won  another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were  why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was  yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed  a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and  why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were  yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn– i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im  oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here  i need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre  im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their– their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are  the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because  im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it– and it scared me  im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbusters i dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im– im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b  skittles so my uterus probably looked  a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act  everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich  mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were  oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats– thats shit you do in your  ok when in– when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was  only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be  were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its  release the kraken and they just come out  a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship  and  yeah and most of the time  we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be  ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he does',\n",
              "  'nt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look  they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be  hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymore im very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre  oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom– shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was   yeah where im from thats  losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was  no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was  yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was  you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyoncé he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted im scared about giving childbirth though im– im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula  what that is  what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser söze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did  that youre gonna poop on the table i was  yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense  that you– that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channel i can already see how theres  this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommy  i– i– i  i berate my husband on  a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant  your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see  a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then  they get big– they get big  fingers  you you you owe me money you my nipples look  whoppers now and naked i look  a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not  when i was  years old when it was  really hot  and i was  why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my– my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporin so  i– i in– previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos  way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and  two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnant all right ive been ali wong have a good night

anthony jeselnik to be a pallbearer its  people hate people hate dead baby jokes they hate them they hate them its  anthony why do you have to tell dead baby jokes why do you have so many dead baby jokes no one likes them why do you insist well ill tell you why because dead baby jokes have made me rich and who was it who was it who said the first million is the hardest was it hitler didnt see that one coming did you that was a good response most audiences just pretend i didnt say it but i  it i  making hitler jokes its cool for me i enjoy it hell i lost my grandfather i lost my grandfather in the holocaust museum it was the holocaust museum of modern art which is just  a normal holocaust museum except you walk around all day being  oh i should have thought of that my grandmother died about a year ago and i didnt think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away but i was wrong it was fine the hard part the upsetting part was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted she wanted to die in the best way possible   you radio winner whats the best way you can die this is not a trick question – in your sleep – yes thank you thank you everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep not me i want to be alert awake surrounded by friends in a house fire but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep we thought thats how she went we were all excited for her but then we did an autopsy found out she actually died horribly in the worst way possible during an autopsy it was fucked up yeah yeah she always said her grandkids didnt pay enough attention to her and and she was right she was dead on but i loved my grandma loved her very much my grandma taught me about a lot taught me what religion is taught me everything you can know about religion in one quick story ill tell you now when i graduated from high school when i graduated my grandma came to me gave me a big hug said anthony im so proud of you youre my first grandchild to get to go to college what can i do for you what can i give you before you go to college and i said honestly grandma all i need from you is money yeah i know you guys have never been but college is expensive and my grandma said  anthony i understand couple months go by its the end of summer im packing up my dads car getting ready to go to school and my grandma walks up says anthony here before you leave take this and she handed me a brandnew bible king james version and i said thanks grandma thats exactly what we talked about i got in the car and i went off to school couple of weeks go by im hanging out in my dorm room having a good time when the phone rings its my grandma anthony just calling to see how college is going grandma college is the best im having the time of my life but to be honest im starting to run low on money and i could use a little bit  we talked about she said  well let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said totally grandma im on chapter four she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later hung up the phone couple of months go by now im really starting to struggle financially might have to drop out of school so i call my grandma in a panic i say please its anthony im having the time of my life in college but if i wanna graduate and i do i need you to send me some money  we talked about sh',\n",
              "  'e said anthony let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said yes grandma i wish it was longer and she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later finally its the end of the school year ive got straight as but im dropping out of college cause i have no more money left and im furious close to tears cleaning out my dorm room when the phone rings its my grandma anthony i heard youre dropping out of school today how come and i said  goddamn well how come grandma cause you wouldnt give me any money she said anthony let me ask you this did you read your bible and i just hung up the phone i was so pissed off took everything out of that room last thing i took off the shelf the last thing i took out of that room was that bible my grandma had given me took it off the shelf held it in my hands and for the first time i actually opened it up and on the very first page in my grandmothers handwriting it said fuck you thank you everyone i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight and all the jokes i write theyre all made up theyre all fake except for eric clapton and the challenger everything else everything else is fake but everything im about to tell you from here until the end of the show thats all true now i dont tell dark jokes because im a comedian im a comedian because i tell dark jokes im kind of fucked up all right ive always been this way i cant really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends its ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyones funeral i asked a friend for advice was  ive never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and dont tell a joke try not to so i walked up and was   what my favorite memory was when i was  four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it  mark twain out of my grandmas mouth it would just come to life and then i couldnt help myself i said and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the n word now i promise you i promise you until youve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wifes funeral at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think im one of the best comedians of all time but heres the thing it doesnt matter if you believe me it really doesnt matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i  to test myself i  to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i  to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i dont believe in too soon im on a tight schedule and im good at it im good at it  the day of the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted other than that how was the movie right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that the reason i get away with stuff  that is im just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didnt make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i dont follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying dont do it and whenever i see that whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad cause i know something horrible has happened people will say anthony whats funny about aurora whats funny about the boston marathon whats funny about your grandmothers funeral nothing nothing is funny about those things thats where i come in so i see these texts and im  oh no what happened but i also think ive got a job to do so i go online i start reading about it i dont want to watch the footage but ill read about what happened and i think how can i make someone laugh today and then i think i got it i go back on twitter and i tweet guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed especially the finish line and again i think nailed it usa usa but then my phone starts to ring and its my boss or should i say my former boss and they say anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today youre also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or youre fired and i say go fuck yourselves and i meant it i didnt get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because im dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said sure they said well anthony you dont understand you dont understand at all if you dont take this joke down right now if you dont delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people theyre also out of a job and im ashamed to tell you this im embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke cause im happy to fight for what i believe in im happy to take the consequences for what ive done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet couldnt do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now ill tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in im just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture theyre  anthony were family why are you so upset cant you see we did you a favor dont you worry about your career let me ask you san francisco do i seem  i worry about my career no  why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if theyre worried about their money they wouldnt have played the lottery in the first fuckin place i do not worry about my career and they said anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems  youre making fun of the victims and thats wrong but thats not what im doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell m',\n",
              "  'e im wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking hey are we trending no this is who im making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston do  what thats worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying dont forget about me today dont forget about me lots of crazy distractions in the news but dont forget how sad i am those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of theyre  a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understand now im sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it its fine its embarrassing but its fun you can laugh at yourself its not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me thats fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess thats what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called shark party all right now some of you enjoyed it but if youve never seen shark party you can never see shark party its been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year  million sharks are killed by human beings every year   people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack im  fuck yeah win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say  what i want to have a shark party as soon as theres a shark attack were having a shark party and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do ive already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark its time for a shark party lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing ive ever said on television smile you son of a bitch shark party and in america where im famous for those types of shenanigans everybody was  anthony that was fucked up it was fucked up to see you dance end of controversy however in new zealand where they dont get my show theyve never seen me and frankly they dont get out much the new zealand media takes the video and they show it to the guys family and they say what do you guys think about this and they say crikey or whatever the fuck they say over there the point is all of new zealand all of new zealand rises up against me all  of those cunts rise up and start threatening my life now i dont read the things that people write about me on the internet but i pay people who do and they come to me and theyre  weve got some terrible news please sit down they say you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of shark party and i was  really new zealand wants to kill me thats weird because they didnt even kill the shark i said how many death threats am i getting and they were  oh all of them you are getting all of the death threats what do you want us to do we can send someone to talk to them extra security what do you want i said no forget about it leave it alone dont worry this might be hard for some to understand ive said it several times tonight everyone is going to die i know full well i am going to die and most of us dont get to choose how we check out but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes best case scenario if somebody murders me over one of my jokes i immediately become a legend im a comedy god the mount rushmore of comedy is me four times i said come on then my security guys are   anthony well just so  that is the dumbest thing weve ever heard but youre the boss  and they leave and then the next day they come back and they say anthony sorry to bother you again i know you didnt care yesterday but its gotten much worse youre gonna wanna hear this they say someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dads phone number and address in pittsburgh posted that online and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand and i have to admit that had never occurred to me before it never crossed my mind that my family my loved ones would ever pay the price be caught in harms way for something ive done or ive joked about and honestly i would cut my throat for my jokes i would give my life for what i do but if anyone and i mean this for a fact if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke ive made even better this man is fantastici watched the show  times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable  great material so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is  but a joke about a famous musicians son falling to his death isnt  where are your priorities theyre just

              " ['   ladies and gentlemen welcome joe rogan  what the fck is going on san francisco thanks for coming i appreciate it god damn put your phone down fckface i see you btch put your phone down motherfckers they cant use their eyes everybodys gotta live through their goddamn phone whoo im high as fck whoo its strange i wasnt sure if i was gonna do this sober im  ugh its not the move not in san francisco this is i love pot but the people that are making edibles need to slow the fck down oh my god what are you trying to do to people i had a pot gummy bear the other day i think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldnt be able to steal your soul right how the fck are these people making these things man theyre not consistent thats also part of the problem you dont know what youre getting cause theyre not making them the same place where they make tylenol nah its some greasy dude with a grateful dead tshirt on and a gray ponytail hes got a bowl of ingredients and he cant remember whether or not he put weed in yet this dudes time traveling just back and forth he just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks  lawn trimmings you eat it and its not what youre looking for its not regulated you gotta ask questions i asked a dude at the pot store i go hey man how strong are the gummy bears he goes thats not a unit of measurement hes  el diablo el diablo fck man how much should i take just the leg just the leg why are you selling whole bears what the fck are you trying to prove man they just watch you leave with that bear they go oh shit they know they know youre not gonna die youre gonna think youre gonna die but everybody lives learn some shit we learn some shit from the scary trips see the thing about edibles one of the problems with it being illegal is that a lot of us dont have a lot of information that we could use  theres a difference between smoking it and eating it when you smoke it you get thc but when you eat it its processed by your liver and it produces something called  metabolite thats five times more psychoactive than thc and it lets you talk to dolphins  this is a real moment that changed my life i was in hawaii and we were on a boat and we were fishing we were pulling these lines behind the boat and i was so high i was trying to figure out which way the earth was spinning  the boats going this way and the suns up there im   for   minutes im paralyzed so while this is all happening these dolphins just show up and if youve ever been around wild dolphins theyre very trippy its very different than you expect because they look at you they  check you out they  pop out of the water and they  look at you  a person not  a fcking deer or woodchuck they look at you  another person granted i was so high i thought i was gonna die but im making eye contact with these dolphins and i started thinking how smart are these fcking things because were fishing dolphins eat fish but you never catch dolphins ever no one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin and all i could think of while these dolphins were  hopping through the water and looking at us and shit i was thinking if people lived in the water youd fcking catch em all day they wouldnt even have to live in the water if cheeseburgers just floated down geary street at least once a week a guy would be  im taking a chance and you see em getting yanked up to the clouds fck we lost billy the bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud you dont catch dolphins on fishhooks man thats weird theyre around fishing all the time and  btch theyre fcking smart how smart well i watched a dolphin documentary and it said they have a cerebral cortex thats  larger than a human beings i dont know what that means but if you say it right and dont fck up the words it makes you sound smarter than you really are i think what it means is they have big fcking brains but we dont think of them as being smart cause they dont do what we do right they dont send emails they dont have houses but if you lived in their world you dont need anything you dont need your fingers no ones typing they have a language thats so complex we cant understand it all the foods free they stay where the waters warm i started thinking how fcking smart are they what if theyre exactly the same as us what if its just some different branch of evolution we went one way they went the other what if consciousness is the same i was thinking what if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin the way you think of yourself when you say the word me i was  what if thats exactly how a dolphin feels theyre just living life through different biology different genetics different life experiences but if i lived a dolphins life i would be him and if he lived my life he would be me and then i started thinking what if thats the case with people what if everyone is exactly the same were just living life through different bodies what if thats the secret of happiness treat everyone as if its you living another life  i mean and then i thought god damn how good is this weed im getting in california whoo im on a fcking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean talking to water people the problem with treating everybody as if its you living another life is you wanna fcking smack yourself half the people you meet you just wanna fcking smack em we live in the weirdest time ever i mean its the most awesome time ever but its the weirdest time ever too were  that close to president trump  no boo no boo you boo but you wont vote you fcks all those bernie sanders people yo bernies the shit did you vote for him voting aint real bro it doesnt even work dude we are that close to president trump bill cosbys a rapist and bruce jenners a chick were in an episode of lost down is up and up is down this is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games this is the world we get we get a goddamn nerfedup world filled with nonsense nobody wants to be president nobody i hope hillary wins that way we can realize chicks cant do that fcking job either its a stupid job its a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers its dumb its just some oldschool shit that we need to get rid of it doesnt make any sense being president is great if theres   people if theres  people you can figure out which ones the best three hundred million people i have three kids i dont know where the fck they are right now how is this one dude in charge of  million people its nonsense its so old and stupid they make this guy sleep in this fcking white house if trump wins  his house is cooler than the white house hes  im not sleeping in that shittyass stupid house trumps probably got  a tube at home that he opens up and a chinese girl just pops out of it and sucks his dick and goes right back in thats what i would do if i had that kind of money were down to assholes wheres elon musk when you need him wheres the fcking geniuses wheres mark cuban no we got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the  we got an old man who hates money and we got a reality tv star with a plastic set of hair you cant have a president with environmental concerns when every time this motherfcker does his hair we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames hes got  a closet full of aqua net at home you cant pretend you dont give a fck when you have that thing going on dude stop that the white house got broken into while obama was in office the first time in over  years that someone broke into the white house also the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself what are you trying to say that women cant do everything men can do exactly thats exactly what im saying that seems sexist right people say youre sexist no its not sexist heres why its not sexist cause men cant even do everything men can do see theres no physical equality folks thats why we have the olympics cause theres people that can do some shit that you and i cant do one of those things is guarding the fcking white house i know i cant guard the white house  how i know because ive met shaquille oneal and his dick is where my face is thats not equality thats not white privilege listen if the white house is experiencing a shaq attack im the wrong dude to save the world i did fear factor with shaq if were holding hands itd be  a six year old at the park with his dad were barely the same thing so do i think women should guard the white house no i dont think i should either its not sexist to say that women cant do big physical labor things as good as giant men can but people will tell you it is well im not sexist as a matter of fact my favorite people are all female i have a wife and i have three daughters theyre my favorite people in the world but i could beat the fck out of all of them  listen if theyre guarding the door im getting in i dont mean to sound cocky but im just real confident i could fck them up if i had the flu  yeah were different were different i could beat up my cat too im not proud of it i just tell you whats up if you wanna bet money bet money on me ill fck that cat up most likely cats are fcking weird  that man i was petting my cat once and he bit me i was  whoa are we gonna do this what the fck are you doing here i got a little nervous got a little nervous women can do everything men can do this guys a piece of shit were leaving too much information is going in that i dont agree with what the guy said was total bullshit total bullshit howd that girl get that job ill tell you how that girl got that job because someone let her have that job which means either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to fck her or her boss was a chick and she hated her either ones possible look if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to fck her that makes total sense if theres one hot girl and shes working with five guys in an office no works getting don',\n",
              "  'e in that office that office is now just an audition to see which guy gets to fck her each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes men become  an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole theres gotta be a fcking way theres gotta be a fcking way you got this girl whos  i could guard the front door oh you could definitely guard the door no doubt no doubt and over time if this woman doesnt sleep with one of these men and claim him over time these guys will just start morphing and theyll just start saying ridiculous preposterous shit debbie wants to guard the front door do you have a problem with that no i dont as a matter of fact i think women are amazing plus im vegan and they will just they will wear patchouli they will do what the fck they have to do next thing  poor fcking debbie at the front door why am i alone  the whole story is so bananas and its one of my favorite stories so im gonna give you the whole story of the breakin at the white house with no edits and no comic exaggerations this is the real story cause a lot of people think theres some grand conspiracy theres some cabal of evil geniuses thats pulling the strings on everyone in america its most likely that people are just dumb as fck in all sorts of walks of life this is the story this is the real story about the person who broke into the white house first of all people are always worried the governments checking out my emails bro the governments watching us all the time they pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the white house he had four handguns two rifles and a machete with him they didnt even watch him he had a map on the map was washington and it had an x where the white house is theyre  youre good to go they let him go two months later this motherfcker broke into the white house and why did he break into the white house why do you break into the white house ever because you want to die you dont thats  a suicide run thats the only reason why someone runs toward the white house if you had to ask someone what kind of security do you think they have at the white house oh dude they got snipers on every corner they got lasers in the grass if you get too far they open up a door you drop right into jail nope turns out they dont even have a dog you just fcking run the guy who made it into the white house he had  rounds of ammunition in his car left that there took a knife thats a guy who wants to die hes just sitting in his fcking car going fck the government fck my exwife and fck everybody im gonna do this fck you just sprinting oh my god im doing it oh my god im doing it thinking with every step this is gonna be the last step of my life no this is gonna be the last step of my life no this and he gets to the front door its unlocked he opens it theres a girl there by herself smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall ah hes probably going why am i alive hes probably thinking he was inside for minutes for minutes running around he got tackled by an offduty officer he was probably thinking i wanted to die i dont want to go to fcking jail will somebody please shoot me then he was probably pissed where are my tax dollars going what kind of security are you fcking people running in this place imagine when obama found out a girl was guarding him he was probably  everybody everybody not that much diversity i mean what are you playing fcking fairy tale games here obamas got a hard job cause hes the first president thats ever been around while google was here  he could google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night right so let me see what the people have to say hed just go obama is a  im none of those fcking things freakin out shit  probably thinking why the fck did i do this i think the guy who broke into the white house and obama probably have a lot in common in that they went for it but they probably never really thought they were getting in there you cant quit once youre the president the moment obama actually got into office  good morning mr president he was probably  oh no what the fck did i do this for i didnt think i was actually gonna get in  i cant sleep im freaking out everybody wants to kill me  who the fck is guarding me looks out in the hallway theres a girl taking selfies thatd be the greatest selfie of all time a girl with her ass out duck lips in the background a dudes breaking into the white house   im not making this up youve all seen this this is recognizable pigeontoed is a good move cause you cant get away that good you just   theres something wrong with your back thats a recognizable pose when did that start cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures everybody just stood there looking hungry  if you saw a photo from the  and in the background a girl was going shes a fcking time traveler nobody knew that move back then

theres places in america you cant live man you dont wanna live in detroit why the fck are you talking about moving to mars people really consider moving to mars its one of the dumbest ideas ever but if you say that people will ecobro you have you ever been ecobroed these people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you as michael shermer likes to point out  puff their chest out and say that theyre probably better than you hey dude seriously you think theres something wrong with going to mars well i dont know if youve paid attention man we maybe should colonize mars cause californias almost out of water then hell nod  yeah btch were right next to the ocean what the fck are you talking about look at all that water you fly over it it takes a day the worlds blue its more water than it is not water we have a salt problem we dont have a water problem suck the salt out of the water we got a goddamn party instead of pissing and moaning too complicated bro we gotta go to neptune oh

what great conversation youre gonna have its nonsense folks my friend was  theyre not gonna die on mars man if people are smart enough to figure out how to get to mars theyre smart enough to figure out how to get back heres why that doesnt make any sense ',\n",
              "  'people smart enough to get to mars arent going see thats the dirty secret about rocket travel ladies and gentlemen nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those fcking things no no they look at each other right before the launch and they go they talk german and they get behind giant fcking concrete bunkers they take some squarejawed cornfed dude from the middle of the country tuck a bible under that dudes arm and strap him into that giant metal dick and shoot it off into the heavens thats what we do and that is what that is that is a metal dick its a robot dick and were trying to fck the sky we are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant and theyre too filled up with people and then they gotta make a new metal dick bro we gotta go to jupiter then they make another one they shoot that fcking thing and they fill jupiter up we just keep filling the cosmos up with people and we never evolve and we never change we stay perfect  we are right now whos in youre gonna all come with me were gonna leave here right now and go to the church of scientology right down the street and its all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it i watched that hbo documentary a couple too many times i went clear i think i think im clear im back im back now if you havent seen  i had to watch going clear a scientology documentary cause i have a neighbor whos a scientologist and i dont even think hes gay i dont know what the fcks going on  but he sleeps really close to me   my beds here this fcking dudes beds  over there his house is i mean if you take away the walls hes fcking right there its  what does this crazy fck believe and scientology is a wonderful religion not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone thats ever walked the face of the earth and not by a small amount this dude never made a second draft in his fcking life everything was one draft of nonsense and he wrote more of it than anybody not in his neighborhood not in his state not in a year not in a decade more than anyone thats ever lived ever and scientology is still  i dont see any red flags i think were good i think this is legit as fck if scientology is a good religion its because other religions get to make fun of em its  its the one religion that even the mormons are  btch you believe what hold on i mean at least we dont have video of joseph smith theres some fcking shitty black and white footage of l ron hubbard with a captains outfit on you wanna explain that  why does he have all those awards on why is tom cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate what the fck is going on with you people i watched it with my mom and it was  first of all scientology they dont pay taxes thats disturbing theyre taxfree which means theyre a recognized religion by the government of the united states which means the government of the united states had to go over what they believe and went everything seems in order none of this shit seems  a cult well what the fck is a cult and whats a religion so i had to look it up turns out i dont know who wrote this but its a perfect definition a cult is bullshit its created by one person that person knows its bullshit in a religion that dudes dead so its a religion cause l ron hubbards dead so i guess they got it on a loophole i watched it with my mom and my mom was  i cant believe anybody would fall for that you made me go to catholic school the fck are you talking about there was a child molester dressed  a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne and you made me call him father slow your roll lady imagine if i talked to my mom  that oh my god jokes folks just jokes i dont have a problem with people being religious because i just think life itself is too openended its too confusing and i think were evolving and part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions we wanna seek these answers but in the meanwhile they just give you so much anxiety and it fcks with you so much theres nothing wrong with joining a cult i think you gotta just join a nice friendly one  the mormons are a good cult heres why they dont get mad at anybody  they never kill anybody  heres a perfect example matt stone and trey parker the guys who created south park they made a hilarious musical called the book of mormon its fantastic if you havent seen it its so fcking hilarious but its also brutal brutal about the mormons  what the mormons did they went to see it and they took out a fullpage ad in the playbill it said if you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a mormon please visit our website they just took it right on the chin  champs they didnt get mad they didnt get defensive they didnt kill anybody thats a good cult they just said what do you wanna do we got nine wives shut the fck up everybody just everybody just chill just chill thats a good religion thats a good cult some cults arent that good they get fcking testy  the one we dont have to say who  what im talking about theres that one that will kill you if you draw their guy come on man i cant even draw your dude what if i draw a dude drawing your dude no loopholes fckin relax bro and this isnt just theoretical people have died cause they made cartoons before the most recent paris attacks there was a magazine called charlie hebdo and they were attacked where  cartoonists were killed eleven more were wounded and they killed a cop too fcking crazy over cartoons and when you when theres radical crazy people in the world whats interesting is the reaction to radical crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird because when these people got killed over a cartoon the whole world was in shock the whole world was outraged but one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures you couldnt see em in the la times you couldnt find them in time magazine you had to go online and find them it was a dark moment for free speech because everybodys  oh i dont wanna get killed i dont wanna show the pictures it was weird until the balance because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures word got back to texas where they promptly held a draw muhammad contest in garland texas im not making a word of this up you can google it and ill wait they had a draw muhammad contest in garland texas two dudes showed up started shooting at the building they were killed almost instantly why because they were at a draw muhammad contest in texas how obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious what are you livin in a wile e coyote cartoon motherfcker you ever go to texas thats not santa monica btch thats a totally different kind of white people those are some wild west people that have computers and modern guns theyre not supposed to be there people didnt evolve in texas its not  they were monkeys then they became people and they stayed in that spot no no they landed on boats on the east coast the stubborn ones stayed the smart ones made it to california but along the way we lost a bunch of people  and some of them just stuck around yall go ahead were gonna hang back here im gonna draw the biggest dick the worlds ever seen in the sand my wifes got the biggest titties imma try to fck a snake i think it can be done they just stayed they just gathered cattle stockpiled ammo and they all talk alike and thats why you gotta be nervous you gotta be nervous in places with accents  its one of the reasons why i can prove that california is the best spot to live cause all the spots that suck they all have to sound  each other cause i grew up in a place  that i grew up in boston its not that the people in boston suck but the weather sucks its fcking horrible and in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning and just goes fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck and everybodys worried about its a real possibility you might starve to death one day you might freeze trying to walk home  so they all talk in the same way oh my god how many more months till summer ahhh when is this fcking winter gonna be over we need more firewood  they have to sound  the people around them so if other people invade  we stick together were all in this together thats how they are in texas too theyre  yall aint from around here are ya they have a fcking certain way of talking which is proof positive why california is the best spot try making fun of a california accent what are you gonna do speak clear and concise what are you gonna do you gonna mock us youre gonna say some shit that everybody understands theyre not supposed to be in texas folks its not even a state its a republic they were  man we aint so sure about this whole united states thing were gonna hang back hang back see how this plays out they dont have any rules they have  three pages of rule books heres how i know this im gonna tell you a fact a fact about texas that will change the way you think about texas there are more tigers in captivity in texas in private collections than there are in all of the wild of the world im gonna repeat it because i know youre  oh the fear factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work no theres more tigers in dudes yards in texas than the rest of the fcking planet how is that possible because they can because they went through the rule book  it dont say shit about tigers order it up dude order it up dude one guy got a tiger and his neighbors  shit i didnt know we could get tigers and he got two tigers and the first guy was  i aint about to let this faggot outtiger me and he opened up tiger world with his oil money were gonna need those people folks if the russians invade we cant make fcking warrior babies with those chicks in marin county with ',\n",
              "  'fake asses and rubber lips  were gonna need some real warrior genes were gonna need some women who wear nonironic daisy dukes they got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet and they yell out chris kyle rest in peace when you make em come we need those women if the russians come we gotta be ready think about the children think about the children while i get a sip this is super important ladies and gentlemen a lot of people are sleeping on  imagine if i had real points oh jesus christ  i love you fckers too man so excited to be here  i have kids and i lie to them i get high around em too people say you shouldnt do that but they dont see it they say you shouldnt be intoxicated around your children well im not im high i call it elevated its a different thing the people who have a problem with that they dont understand what getting high is  they think youre gonna be to your kid  who are you what do you think whats the worst thing that can happen if im a little high around my kid theyre gonna get extra hugs and daddys going to be paranoid about objects look out dont go there thats it plus i have cool conversations i have a six year old daughter man theres not a lot of  man and  girl have in common other than the fact shes my daughter and so our conversations are normally pretty boring but when im high im   you call that thing your baby your doll you call it your baby but  its not a baby right yeah i know its not a baby do you call it a baby because youre the youngest and you  having someone who is responsible for you maybe  thats cool thats cool give me a hug i love you  its weird man its weird raising little people theres some things that i didnt expect one of the things i didnt expect is you have to lie to them  you dont have to lie to them about a lot of things but you have to lie to them about santa claus its just one of those things man cause its  a community you have to think about what your kids gonna tell other kids because when it comes to santa claus you dont want your kid to be one of two things you dont want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that santa claus is bullshit cause that kids an asshole but you dont want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that santa claus is bullshit cause that kids a moron so you got you got a little bit of youre  oh no when do we do this when do we do this and no one knows when to do it you just let the kids figure it out then theyre  dad what the fck youre  aw oh i missed the boat i missed the boat nobody knows when to do it nobody can be honest about it they have little meetings and shit and im  when do we tell em this lady goes when theyre  theyre gonna be fcking by then i told her it was funny she didnt believe me im  oh im sorry im off by a year thats not as funny but its i didnt mean it but its this thing they want to keep the kids in the dark and they wanna pretend theyre the only one thats teaching the kid this is a weird thing that people do theyre  i teach my kids man i teach my kids eh when you see em but unless youre some freak who homeschools your children in the forest your kids gonna go to school theyre gonna go to school and theyre gonna be in a class with  other kids the teacher only makes  bucks a year and shes thinking about dick thats all shes thinking about shes thinking about getting stuffed shes a young fertile woman who loves kids and shes writing on that chalkboard and the kids all huddle up and share information  yeah what did your dad tell you your dad tell you that yeah my dad says santa claus is fcking bullshit  you ever go near a chimney its that big what the fck teachers coming play with blocks act stupid  how does this work they play dumb they play dumb theyre  little prisoners trying to figure their way out they make little papiermâché heads and pretend theyre napping theyre little humans they wanna run shit who is these people telling us what to do are they being straight with us man what the fck is going on i knew the day my daughter knew that santa claus is bullshit she came home stared me down she was  maddogging me she took her book bag and just goes  walked right up to the chimney looking at me how the fck dad have you ever met santa claus no honey ive never met him but you let him in the house and theres this moment it was a moment where a seven year old has you at checkmate youre  oh shit i dont know whether to highfive her or to keep lying you wanna go yeah you got me you got me you got me thats bullshit no the big bang is real but this is bullshit the big bang sounds even less real the problem is you have to be consistent if youre teaching your kids nonsense you gotta teach em only nonsense you cant mix nonsense in with  real stuff  my daughter will go  how do birds fly i go birds have bones that are hollow so theyre really light then they have feathers which cover a large surface area and they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air see the air looks  its nothing right but its actually a bunch of gases thats why the trees move when the wind blows the birds can manipulate that and go through  space whoa yeah nature is crazy yeah how does the fat man get through the little hole magic christmas magic now go to bed im trying to fck your mom go to bed  jokes folks just jokes cant talk  that thats how you make strippers you gotta be nice theyre little tiny people theyre adorable they dont know anything yet you gotta teach em everything you cant talk mean  kids are a lot  really fcking stupid people in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room the most confident one just starts running shit they dont have to have any more information they just have to be more confident if you get a bunch of dummies together theyre  i dont know whats going on i dont know whats going on i fcking do i fcking do the guy doesnt have to have any extra data he just has to be the only one thats confident and thats what its  in school my daughters class has this fcking kid named debbie and every day its debbie says oh fcking debbie says debbie says what you dont think about that before you have kids not only are you gonna have kids but your kids are gonna make friends and then you have to make friends with the fcking parents of your kids and some of em are crazy my daughters  debbie says adam and eve are the only two people in the world and all people came from them is that true  and this is weird  you dont know what to do right you want to be diplomatic you dont want to cause problems at school but you gotta be honest and one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is i dont know im  sweetie i dont know i dont know if adam and eve is where people came from but nobody knows because no one from today is alive back then so its not something you can measure so its not something you can see so we dont know but heres what we do know  how some people have big ears and some people have little ears yeah well some people have brains that are made out of dog shit and they get horny too and what happens is they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with its  the opposite of evolution and then they have a kid and their kid is fcked their kid is fcked and everybody wants to pretend its a level playing field theres no level anywhere you look is an eagle and a salmon level does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle no the universe does not want even it wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement  im gonna shut this light out and im gonna go fck your mom right in the mouth all right i dont say these things i dont say any of these things i was  i dont know maybe debbies right doesnt make sense to me how would that work how would that work it wouldnt work would it adam and eve are the only two people they have kids and then where do all the other people come from i guess the kids just start fcking each other is that what happens mom fcks the kids or the yeah exactly debbies parents they were at my house man for a cookout and the dude told me the earths  years old theyre young earth christians theyre sweet people by the way before i shit on them im gonna shit on them but before i shit on them theyre sweet theyre really nice people i hug em every time i see em theyre really kind nice people but they just found a part of their brain theyre  i have no use for this  chucked that whole logic discerningreason part this fcking things confusing theyre young earth christians which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the bible possible im  how many people believe the earth is less than  years old  i looked it up theres a recent gallup poll that said that  of america believes the earth is less than  years old  heres why you shouldnt be scared they can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls and when you factor that in youre talking about a really small number cause  what the average response is if you call people up and say how olds the earth number one answer is older than your mothers pussy and then they hang up number two answer is fck you after that you start throwing numbers around and only  of those dummies were stupid enough to think the earth is  years old thats debbies fcking parents so out of the people that answer polls is it even  it might be  only  are that fcking stupid and thats the  we should really be worried about were worried about the wrong  not that we shouldnt be worried about the really rich greedy people we definitely should we should definitely worry about bankers and people who theyre just stockpiling resources they could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else but they dont theyd rather just pile up their gold  yeah that  is awful but theres another  that freaks me the fck out that no ones talking about thats the  who leave comments on youtube videos who the fck are those freaks could you imagine people talking to each other  that in real life and not beating the shit out of each',\n",
              "  ' other i mean if jesus christ himself came back from the dead and had a youtube page the first comment would be you aint shit without your dad pussy these are monsters this is not a normal persons response normal people dont leave comments what a normal person does they watch a video they  it or they dont  it thats it it ends right there but what youre dealing with is the process of racism and child abuse and neglect and shitty genes and the insane clown posse is playing they know all the words and theyre wafting up their farts and their cheez doodle fingers and  an open letter to jennifer lopez let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick here  ugh dear jennifer dont you think its about time you dress a little more classy what are your children gonna see

women  and im becoming more of a btch every day of my life and i just wanna say im not unhappy ive never been more happy in my life this is the happiest ive ever been but when youre with all girls  you have all girls all the time you have to make little compromises you dont think about it while its happening its  the rock doesnt think about the water carving a path through it but eventually that fcking path is gonna get deep and when youre with all people that are different than you they just go hmm they just start looking at you  little raptors testing the fence  theyll just start poking at

song huh what are you a character in a book you piece of shit no ones honest no ones honest about how much we need other people thats why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that dont need people the people who just walk away from it all  wow what a rebel but in real life we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement so think about that youre in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers and the worst shit they can do is leave you alone were fcking weird we are weird cause what we are really is were some weird superorganism that  needs each other in some sort of strange way but were all in denial im kind of a loner oh shut the fck up theres no such thing its not real every person in this room me included all of us we are all a calculation were all an ongoing onrunning calculation of all the interactions youve ever had with all the people that youve ever met and you do a bunch of things that people  and start doing more of that youre  ill do more of that you find things that people dont  youre  ill keep that shit to myself hmm i dont  that feeling hmm thats what we do thats what we do its weird we dont want to admit it but thats who we all are and im just telling you this because ive never been more of a btch right now i have slowly but surely bent until im in this position this is how im riding out my days just  this     but im also telling you right now that im not going out  bruce jenner oh thats right politically correct san francisco heres my take on this bruce jenner thing and  everybody has their own not really this is what everybodys take is this is the take that youre supposed to have hes always been a woman trapped in a mans body maybe definitely maybe definitely people are  that definitely there are people who were born in the wrong gender and am i saying they should stay their gender no who gives a fck you should do whatever you wanna do you should be happy you should be free i dont care what you do but its also possible that maybe if you live with crazy btches long enough you become one thats all im saying i dont see this discussed it is entirely possible if you put a praying mantis on a leaf it becomes the color of the leaf why because it wants to live it wants to survive it wants to be accepted by its environment you show me a man whos lived with the kardashians for ten years who didnt come out a chick and then well have some data  cause right now we lost a fcking american olympian and i want you to have some respect were down bruce jenner and ive got a close eye on kanye west and i dont exactly  what im seeing  look at kanye west hes a very talented young heterosexual man who starts a clothing line hes clearly jealous about taylor swift and he tweets  a cokedup stripper in the middle of the night you dont see what im seeing we are watching the plot of a fcking stephen king book play out an american athletic hero moves in with a woman whos made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone he breaks up with her she turns him into a chick the whole world tells him hes beautiful you tell me you dont see what im seeing you have to say you have to say shes beautiful shes beautiful shes not beautiful and neither am i look i look  a thumb with two thumbs  you put me in a dress id be even more disgusting beautys unusual theres a lot of cool shit that isnt beautiful sixty year old dudes in skirts are on that list jesus fcking christ what kind of games are we playing here why are you lying to children thats beautiful what are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose is that beautiful too daddy explain ahhh bang i cant the worlds gone fcking bananas what youre saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive you should be embarrassed at what youre doing youre doing this just to get laughs at someone elses expense maybe or maybe bruce jenner lived with demons maybe they waited by the bed until they knew he was in heavy rem sleep so they could assume their true form  climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black ravens claws clutched the edge of the bed and just whispered in his ear   bruce  we would  you better if you were one of us  i cant i cant be one of you i was i was born a man nonsense   nonsense bruce you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth youre free bruce  your lips are too thin for the cover of vanity fair huh what wait wait did you say the cover  are you fcking with me because

then thank you i married my wife i love saying my wife it sounds so adult thats my wife its great you sound  a person i said it even before we were married we were just dating and we were once getting on an airplane and annas ticket didnt say anything and my ticket said priority access it doesnt matter why but we were getting on and i said  can my wife board with me and they were  yes of course right this way and i was  oh that is so much better than all those times i was  can my girlfriend come and yeah i shouldnt have said it that way but still my wife just has some kickass to it  get away from my wife no one talk to my wife marriage is gonna be very magical i didnt kill my wife thats  ooh whos that fella i bet he did kill his wife being married is so nice i never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself thats not really a joke thats just a little sweet thing i  to say cause id been in relationships where i got cheated on  long ones i dont know if youve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on but it changes your whole worldview cause when i was a kid i used to watch americas most wanted  how kids do and i would always think to myself how could another person kill someone how could a human being kill another human being and then i got cheated on and i was  oh  im not gonna do it but i totally get it and i dont mean in that way of  no one else can have you i dont care about that its just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly they have a lot of information anyone whos seen my dick and met my parents needs to die i cant have them roaming around i talked to a lot of people before i got engaged  and i heard this expression about whether or not you should get married this is an old expression people say this they say why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free you ever heard that before its a bananas insulting expression to an entire gender but also it makes no sense why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free youre not allowed to milk a cow that you dont own thats not even a situation was that a problem at one point  in the dairy community was that happening a hundred years ago in some village some dutch prick was sneaking in at night being  ahhaha i take your milk and the farmer was  well then this is your cow now and he was  no no proof of purchase and he ran off into the night that sounded dutch right  what that  what that expression means it means why would you marry a woman if shes already having sex with you which has nothing to do with what relationships are even  anymore now its  why buy the cow  maybe because every day the cow asks you when youre gonna buy it and  you live in a really small apartment with the cow so you cant avoid that question at all and also the cow is way better at arguing than you are and the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue why buy the cow  maybe because every time another cow gets bought you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale and your cow looks over at you the entire time  and does not enjoy the sale at all even though shes the one that wanted to go to the sale and shes especially mad because that farmer and cow met  eight months after you guys met why buy the cow well lets be real here youre very lucky to have the cow that you do have roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for john by the most liberal of estimates there have been about eight cows total several unmilked and a lot of people think that you  bulls and if you just bought they assume it when you search your name the third thing to come up is  john mulaney bull and if you just bought the cow nobody would say that anymore theyll still say it cause there are those guys who they buy a cow and then on the side total matador but but for real chicago why buy the cow lets be real why buy the cow because you love her you really do and yeah yeah sure shes a bossy little jew but  she takes care of you and you dont wanna be some old man stumbling around  hey you seen any loose milk my wife is jewish shes a new york jew i did it now i was raised catholic i dont know if you can tell that from the everything about me my wife is jewish i grew up catholic so we got married by a friend being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families religions while confusing the elderly people at the wedding whats the name of the bishop thats actually standup comedian dan levy he was the host of mtvs your face or mine i saw a lot of catholic weddings though because i was an altar boy and a hush falls over the room isnt it weird how that became a scandalous thing that was just some boring shit i had to do on weekends but now its  saying i was a french maid for a period of time i was treated well in my day i worked for a variety of sirs no being an altar boy was just a boring gig  youd serve mass and then youd serve weddings sometimes my brother was once an altar boy at a wedding and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big packed church in chicago where we grew up and the bride was coming down the aisle and the organ was playing and all the pews were filled and the bride got all the way to the altar and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride and right at that moment the other altar boy said aw shes ugly and then they looked and they were right next to the video camera and i know thats awful but wouldnt you give a million dollars to see that wedding video it was the best moment of this stupid womans life and shes walking down the aisle and the organs  and she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of god and right at that second for no reason at all some cheetofingered ratmustached  prick decides to go aw shes ugly hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be  aw shes beautiful shes enchanting i grew up catholic i dont go to church anymore but i went on christmas eve with my parents cause  how you lie to your parents so we go into the church and i was  i got this under control and then i got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit no i was going through mass and i was batting   and then in the middle of mass the priest said peace be with you and everyone said and with your spirit and i was the one  asshole going and also with you what huh what huh what when when for those of you that arent catholic i dont mean to exclude you even though we love to exclude you but theres a part in church where the priest says peace be with you and for many many years we all said – and also with you – very good but they changed it to and with your spirit because thats what needed revamping in the catholic church that was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease in rome they were  lets see what problems can we solve problem one no im actually glad they changed that though i never liked and also with you i always found that clunky and also with you thats not how you talk – have a nice day – and also you having one its just a li',\n",
              "  'ttle bit wrong isnt it its just a little off  when someones  how are you and youre  nothing much and it sort of makes sense never begin a sentence with and also you just immediately sound caught offguard it sounds  if at the first church ever  they werent expecting it  the priest was  hey this is the first time weve ever had church i just wanna say peace be with you and they were  what oh  yeah and also you should have some hey thats good lets keep that for  years and then change it to trick john my wife and i dont have any children we have a dog we have a little puppy named petunia shes a tiny little french bulldog puppy i  having a puppy thats a bulldog cause its  having a baby that is also a grandma her body is young her face is as old as time she definitely saw the nazis march into paris she always gives me this look of  oh the things i have seen you cocksucker you have no idea the gestapo threw my printing press into a river but go tell your fucking jokes bring me my dish she said that petunia petunia is my best friend in the world i give her a million kisses a day she does not  me and barks at me and bites me all day long we had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because petunia is a bad dog we tell her that every day we go hey youre bad at being a dog so the trainer came into the apartment sorry didnt even walk into the apartment walked into the threshold and went oh   she was an exorcist or something she said i see what the problem is she said petunia has become the alpha of the house and then she pointed at me she said you are no longer the alpha of the house and in the back of my head i was  i was never the alpha of the house i turned to my wife i was  lets pretend itll be fun yes my title of alpha which i once had how can i reclaim it because that was a thing that existed at one time she said you need to show dominance over your puppy these are things people say to me i said how do i do that she said well let me ask you this who eats dinner first you or petunia i was  petunia eats dinner first she eats dinner at  pm cause shes a foot long and two years old she said no you need to eat dinner first because the king eats before anyone else eats oh yes and what a mighty king i will be eating dinner at  in the afternoon look upon your sovereign petunia and tremble my lands stretch across this entire one bedroom and i eat dinner whenever i choose as long as it works for the schedule of a dog she said now you dont actually have to eat dinner before petunia you just have to convince petunia that youve already eaten so for the past month i shit you not before my wife and i give petunia her dish we take down empty bowls and spoons and in front of her we go mmm dinner mmm good dinner  were space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote but they didnt work that hard on mmm were eating dinner meanwhile petunias just staring at us with her paul giamatti face  youre not eating dinner cocksucker dish now i have a wife and a dog and we just bought a house we have a new house it was built in the  but it was flipped in  which means its haunted but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash actually we didnt buy a house a bank bought a house and im allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while i pay it off for  years the woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for  years and she said so for instance this is what youll pay in july of  and i burst out laughing i was   thats not a real year by  ill be drinking moon juice with president jonathan taylor thomas im not gonna be writing you a paper check i  having a house but i loved looking for a house cause i love real estate agents i mean they are the true heroes they really are have you ever watched hgtv real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives every episode of hgtv is  craig and stacia are looking for a twostory aframe thats near craigs job in the downtown but also satisfies stacias need to be near the beach which is nowhere near craigs job with three children and nine on the way and a max budget of  lets see what lori jo can do on this weeks episode of you dont deserve a beach house i loved our real estate agent it was so fun to hang out with her it was  hanging out with my mom cause  real estate agents always look  your mom and they have various chicos accoutrements they always have kind of fun mom energy and theyre always so excited to see you two we would have little conferences before we walked into a house shed go lets talk lets talk before we go in were  two feet from the door so theres no toilets and i know that was on your list but i think i can get him to budge lets go so wed have a real estate agent and then  the house would have a real estate agent whos just some guy sitting in a big chair and these two always hated each other theyd be  hi tony hi kim its  jesus christ what were you two in the eagles together what is the animosity about our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives more than anyone in our family she hinted about it constantly every room she walked into shed be  so this could be an office or maybe a nursery yeah no  we said we dont know if were gonna have  no no i know i know  you dont know if youre gonna have em but   you never know sometimes you dont know whats gonna happen and then  something happens well yeah thats how all of life works  all right  uhhuh mmm this is an onfire garbage can could be a nursery she showed me a backyard once she goes i dont even  this backyard for you i was  oh do tell she said its all pavement i think you should have some grass out there  in case you have a couple little guys running around in the grass and i got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids i was  hey lady i went outside about as much as powder from the movie powder my children are not gonna be playing out on grass they will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles these are my children and thats my wife i didnt mean to make it sound  we dont want children we dont but i didnt mean to make it sound  that see i just dont think babies  me very much sometimes babies will point at me and i dont care for that shit at all  ill be on an elevator and a baby will be there in its big  stroller activity tray just  working on one cheerio with bobby fischerlike intensity and itll look up at me and go i  to lean in and go stop snitchin motherfucker and then walk off cause youre never too young to learn our national nosnitching policy my friends have babies and i dont do so well with them i had a runin with a two year old girl i know there are better ways to start that story but my friend jeremy has this two year old girl and i really  her shes a sweet kid i really  his daughter a lot but i was over at his familys house for the fourth of july and he had his daughter on his knee and it was a very lovely day his whole extended family was there and he was bouncing his two year old up and down and he pointed at me and he said to his two year old do  who that is thats your uncle john and i was  oh my god thats so sweet im her uncle john and then the baby pointed at me and said uncle john has a penis i thank you for laughing because no one did that day fell deadly silent is what they all did hey do  what youre supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says he has a penis no im asking cause i dont know what to say in that situation heres what i went with that day i said oh come on i dont know i thought thatd be good but then it just made it worse cause it sounded  the baby and i had an arrangement not to talk about it and she had violated my trust  the baby had been  do you have a penis and i was  yes i do but youre a baby so discretion is key and then the next day she goes he has a penis and i go oh come on someone cant keep a secret luckily jeremys wife saved the day the babys mom saved the day she came in and she picked up the baby and she was  its  shes just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot arent we all and by the way it wouldve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina  if a grown woman had walked in the room and the baby had been  she has a vagina the woman could be  yes i do and its magnificent and we would all be  hooray you are brave no one wants to applaud the penis of a  weirdo its fun to be married ive never been supervised before im supervised she studies what i do  an anthropologist shell be  sometimes he will watch a movie on tv even though he already owns that movie on dvd pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him i had no supervision when i was a kid we were free to do what we wanted but also with that no one cared about kids i grew up before children were special i did very early  right before children became special  i remember when milk carton kids became a thing when they were  hey we should start looking for some of these guys i dont think theyre just blowing off steam no one car',\n",
              "  'ed about my opinion when i was a little kid no one cared what i thought sometimes people would say what do you think youre doing but that just meant stop they didnt actually wanna know my thought process they didnt want me to be  well i was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs so that when i lit off the bottle rocket the eggs would explode everywhere oh well thats very interesting and what brought you to this experiment oh well thank you for asking well  how im filled with rage im so horny and angry all the time and i have no outlet for it so eggs your opinion doesnt matter in elementary school either it matters in college college is just your opinion just you raising your hand and being  i think emily dickinsons a lesbian and theyre  partial credit and thats a whole thing but in elementary school it doesnt matter what you think it just matters what  you have to have answers to questions and if you say i dont know you get an x on your test and you get it wrong and thats not fair cause your brain has never been smaller also thats not how life works im in my  now if you came to me now and you were  hey john name three things that the stamp act of  accomplished id go i dont know get out of my apartment  but when youre a little kid you cant say i dont know you should be able to that should be an acceptable answer on a test you should be able to write in i dont know i know you told me but i have had a very long day i am very small and i have no money so you can imagine the kind of stress that i am under or if its one of those true or false questions you should be able to add a third option which is whos to say kids are much more supervised now but also they have a lot of rights  thats the biggest civil rights increase ive seen in my lifetime the rights of children have gone through the roof i had no rights when i was a little kid i remember one time i walked into a supermarket by myself and i walked in through the double doors and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went no and i went all right and i turned around and left thats how broken i was and there werent special things for kids the way there are now  we would just go see movies any movie  back to the future that was a movie everyone could see kids could kinda see it great movie right i rewatched it recently its a very weird movie marty mcfly is a  high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist and i shit you not they never explain how they became friends they never explain it not even in a lazy way  hey remember when we met in the science building they dont even do that and we were all fine with it we were just  what whos his best friend a disgraced nuclear physicist all right proceed what a strange movie to sell to be a family movie two guys had to go in and do that they had to be   we got an idea for the next big familyactioncomedy all right its about a guy named marty and hes very lazy hes always sleeping late  is he cool  ferris bueller no but he does have this best friend whos  a disgraced nuclear physicist im confused here this best friend this is another student no no no no this guys either   or  even we dont know how old this guys supposed to be but one day the boy and the scientist they go back in time and they build a time machine whoa  i think i see where youre going here they build a time machine and they go back in time and they stop the kennedy assassination ah oh wow thats a really good idea i mean we didnt even think of that all right well what do they do with the time machine well now im embarrassed to say ah well all right all right all right we thought we thought it would be funny  if the boy if he went back in time and  he tried to fuck his mom i dont know we thought thatd be fun for people but no good point no he doesnt get to he doesnt get to cause this family friend named biff he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son the dads gotta beat the rapist off of her and also were gonna imply that a white man wrote johnny b goode so were gonna take that away from em well this is the best movie idea i have ever heard in my life were gonna make three of them now you say they go to the past how about we call it back to the past no no no back to the future right but they go to the past yeah kids have it very good now my friends a teacher she told me that  the parents will take the kids side over the teacher now thats insane that never happened my parents trusted every grownup more than they trusted me i dont mean coaches and teachers any human adults word was better than mine any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been  excuse me your kid bit my dick and my mom would be  john edmund mulaney did you bite this nice mans dick and i would be the only one whos  hey doesnt anyone wanna know why his dick was near my biters in the first place isnt anyone curious as to how i had access dont get me wrong my parents love us they just didnt  us we werent friends people are now  my moms my best friend i was  oh is she a super bad mom my parents didnt trust us and they shouldnt have trusted us we were little goblins we were terrible i remember one time we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids three weeks before we went to the resort my dad sat us down and he said all right were going to a resort and ive just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm and we were  oh yes yay yes now im telling you three weeks in advance so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm oh were gonna freak out so bad yes john you have a question how did he lose his arm thats exactly what you wont ask and then i did ask i went into the kitchen one day and i was  so howd you lose your arm and he was  well i was born with only one arm and i was  nah no my parents loved us its just  they were the cops  and we were criminals so we didnt get along we only got along in that way that  cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals  when my dad and i would talk it was  that scene in the movie heat when robert de niro and al pacino sit down in that diner we kind of had that rapport of  hmm were not so different you and i you have your law practice and me i have all these fucking markers i guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way my dad would respect it if i could get away with breaking a rule we had a rule in our house you were not allowed to watch tv on a school night so every school night i would  be watching tv and i would hear my dad coming i would immediately turn the tv off and grab any book magazine periodical anything and id open it and pretend to be doing homework my dad would walk in the room and he would go what are you doing are you watching tv and id go no man im not watching tv and the tv wouldnt even be dark yet it would still have  a neon green halo around it itd be sizzling  a glass of pepsi and i would look my dad in the eyes and go no im just reading this yellow pages my dad loved us he just didnt care about our general happiness or selfesteem i remember one time we were really little kids i have two sisters and a brother and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to wisconsin my dad was driving going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood you remember that era where we were  how much wood can we get on this car without it catching on fire but then the big announcement we here at plymouthchrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car for all those times youve looked at your minivan and thought huh it needs a belt so were going on the highway weve been on the road for three hours and in the distance we see a mcdonalds we see the golden arches and we got so excited we started chanting mcdonalds mcdonalds mcdonalds mcdonalds and my dad pulled into the drivethru and we started cheering and then he ordered one black coffee for himself and kept driving and  as mad as that made me as a little kid in retrospect that is the funniest thing i have ever seen in my entire life how perfect is that he had a vanload of little kids and he got black coffee the one thing from mcdonalds no child could enjoy my dad is coldblooded he once shushed a kid during lion king on broadway that actually happened we were at lion king on broadway and there was a five year old behind us going look its pumbaa look its timon and my dad turned around and said are you going to talk the entire time hes my hero the weirdest thing when i was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed they scared us about it constantly and ive been on tour this year marijuana is legal in  or  states in some form or another its insane yeah well all right dont whoo if youre white its always been legal for us come on sir we dont go to jail for marijuana you silly billy when i was arrested with a onehitter at a rusted root concert i did not serve hard time i think i got an award ',\n",
              "  'eighteen or  states and by the way i agree its a very good thing but its also a really weird thing because this is the first time ive ever seen a law change because the government is just  fine  ive never seen it before  gay marriage and healthcare we have to battle it out in the supreme court and be  gay people are humans and theyre  well think about it but with weed it was just something we wanted really badly and we kept asking them for  years  excuse me and then suddenly the government became  cool parents and theyre just   here take a little wed rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else blah blah blah blah blah those stupid parents and thats a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly it would be on our sitcoms wed be watching saved by the bell wed be having a great old time and then suddenly a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks and theyd always hold the joint the bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way theyd always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint  its a skull in a shakespeare play and now its legal and that is great news unless youre a weed dealer and then it is terrible news and i dont just mean because theyre about to lose out to amazoncom i more feel bad for weed dealers cause theyre about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product and we dont show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products  when the chinese food delivery guy comes we dont let him hang out after hes delivered the chinese food and we dont look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls were hanging out with to try to preserve the relationship and we definitely dont give him some of the chinese food hes never  hey can i get in on those dumplings and were  yeah were all friends what are you on your phone hey vneck hey – whats your name – sam sam cool what do you do to afford vnecks sam typing numbers ah numbers the letters of math im sorry to bother you i dont mean to single you out i hate when people get pulled out of the audience  are you familiar with the cirque du soleil sam theyre a group of french assholes that are slowly taking over america by humiliating audience members one by one we once went to see cirque du soleil at navy pier when i was a kid and my brother came and he was  years old you remember being  when youre  no one look at me or ill kill myself and these french bastards come into the crowd being  le volunteer and they pulled my brother up on stage and i was  no and they brought him up and they reached into his sweatshirt and they were  and they had planted a bra and they pulled out a bra and they were  and everyone at navy pier was  ah ha ha ha ha and my brother was  thats great i have had other jobs besides comedy i was an office temp for a while i really miss that i loved being a temp because i would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week and then you just get to retire  lou gehrig youre  thank you no one will ever see me again and theyre  goodbye i worked at an office once on  street in new york city i was there for a couple weeks i was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle this woman named mischa sat in the other cubicle i want to get the number right i think mischa had about  photos of her daughter up in her cubicle almost  she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter a beautiful mindstyle i think about mischa two times a week because of a phone call she had next to me one day it was one of my first days and i was sitting next to her and her phone rang and this was her call and im quoting her phone rang and she said hello hush and then she hung up think about that two times a week and i didnt know her well enough by then to be  hey what kind of a person are you  who could she have been talking to hello hush this was a place of business my only thought was that it was the ceo of the company being  mischa help im doing a crossword puzzle i need a fourletter word for be quiet right now – hush – youre promoted i temped at a little web company on  street in new york city it was a small web company owned by this old man who was old old old money new york his name was henry j finch iv  old old old money  his money was in molasses or something he owned this web company i have no idea why he owned this web company i think he won it in a rich mans game of dice and small binoculars or something mr finch wore linen suits he had suspenders he had a bow tie he had a hat he had a cane with an ivory handle im giving you more description than you need cause i need you to believe me this was a real person i knew in the  century mr finch was in his  he had an assistant named mary she was in her  she was korean i dont know why he had an assistant he did not need one unless he needed someone to be  remember mr finch at five oclock you need to keep looking  a hardboiled egg one day mr finch came into the office it had been raining everything im about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon mr finch walked into the office and he was wearing a raincoat he was wearing a rain hat and he had his cane and he walked in and he said and im quoting ah one feels  a duck splashing around in all this wet and when one feels  a duck one is happy and then mary yelled ooh ducklings to which mr finch replied too old to be a duckling quack quack and then walked into his office i think about that every goddamn day i mean imagine youre me youre a  temp and youre so hungover and you just wanna die every day and then that happens in front of you and i dont know gives you hope and i did that a little fast let me break that conversation down for you mr finch walked in and he began a conversation the way anyone would ah one feels  a duck splashing around in all this wet the rain and when one feels  a duck one is happy now thats debatable but rather than debate that point mary brought up a new separate but interesting point which was ducklings but mr finch ever the realist about his own age and mortality said ah too old to be a duckling as if to say my duckling days are behind me mary dont you see im a duck now and to prove it well ill say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has quack quack and i knew right at that moment by the way that it meant nothing to mr finch what he had said crazy people are  that they have unlimited crazy currency  if i had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been  hey finch you remember that time you were  too old to be a duckling quack quack he would just be  ah perhaps i did quack but such is life for an old knickerbocker  me  hed say something else crazy thats the wonderful thing about crazy people  is that they just have unlimited currency the things they say mean nothing to them but they mean everything to me i was once walking into penn station in new york i was walking down  street towards eighth avenue im walking down  theres this woman standing at eighth and  i have my little roller suitcase you can all imagine im walking towards her shes smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore shes watching me walk kind of scanning me up and down as if she had terminator vision where she could see little bits of data  little honky ass and could read information as i walked past her she said this to me i walked past her and she said and im quoting eat ass suck a dick and sell drugs very dirty yes a very upsetting thing to hear yes im sorry you all had to hear that but at least you all got to hear it as a group i was alone out there that afternoon and she said this totally unprompted eat ass suck a dick and sell drugs it wasnt  i had paused in front of her and been  what should i do with my life so i walk away from her with this todo list and i  structure i  a todo list it did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along when you really think about it cause it starts in a pretty rough place it starts with just about the worst task a todo list can start with but by the end you have your own small business and isnt that the american dream when alls said and done that if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick one day you can sell drugs imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs and you were  but i this has been a real thrill to perform here by the way i just wanna say that in all sincerity thanks for coming to this really really appreciate it i wanna tell you one more story before i get out of here about the night i met a guy named bill clinton now i dont some of  who that is for those of you that dont he was president of the united states from  until  and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared emperor of the united states of america now i know  who bill clinton is but i was doing a show at a college and i mentioned bill clinton and  they kind of didnt know who he was  sorry they knew the name right but they only knew this  bill clinton whos a very different bill clinton ',\n",
              "  'have you seen his ass lately what the hell is he trying to pull hes all thin now and he wears these little tight suits and hes got these grandpa reading glasses  hey i cant do nothing to nobody no more oh me im just an old old man i dont have the appetites  and hes always flying around the world with bill gates trying to cure aids that is not the bill clinton that we all signed up for  years ago our bill clinton was  a big fat buddy garrity from friday night lightslooking guy who played the saxophone on arsenio and his work in the std community was not in curing anything at that time that was the man we all elected president that was the bill clinton that i met i got to meet bill clinton when he was governor clinton in  when he was first running for president and i got to meet bill clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as bill clinton theyre a little younger but they went to the same college so when he was first running for president he would have all these big  alumni fundraisers and everyone who went was invited to go now this was really cool for a couple reasons one i got to meet bill clinton but two i got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president and that is super funny to see cause think about some of the people you went to school with now imagine theyre becoming the president imagine sam was becoming the president it would stir up strong emotions and my parents had very different opinions on bill clinton my mom loved bill clinton cause bill clinton was always a really charismatic handsome guy i mean think about how many women he got in the  when he looked  frank caliendo doing john madden now imagine him as a college student and my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then where late at night if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home that sounds good right so my mom tells me that bill clinton would be out in front of the library every single night just being  hey can i walk ya home hey can i walk ya home hey can i walk ya home hey can i walk ya home and one night my mom was leaving the library and bill clinton was  hey can i walk ya home and my mom was  hell yes so this is absolutely true my mom little ellen stanton walked arminarm with bill clinton to her dorm and she was   i wanted to invite him up for a beer and i was  thanks im nine but her roommate was upstairs so she lost her chance with bill clinton now my dad on the other hand hated bill clinton because my parents were dating during this time and also my dads a much more morallyupright conservative kind of guy he always told me that he hated it in college that bill clinton could quote get away with anything can you imagine how he felt later so one day this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet bill clinton my mom opens it first and she goes oh we have to go we have to go see bill and without looking up at her my dad just says why its not  hes gonna remember you one black coffee same motherfucker so my mom says fine ill go and ill take john and i was  hell yeah and i slid in the room in my first communion suit ready to go cause i loved bill clinton i was ten years old if you were a kid when bill clinton was first released it was the most exciting thing ever wed never seen a cool politician before and he would go on mtv and hed have cool answers to kids questions theyd be  governor whats your favorite food and hed be  i dont know fries and wed be  yay we eat fries i learned to play his campaign song on the piano it was dont stop by fleetwood mac from rumours an album written by and for people cheating on each other he let us know who he was right away so i went with my mom as her date to reconnect with governor bill clinton we walked into the ballroom it was a big hotel ballroom it was the palmer house hilton big hilton hotel ballroom walked into the ballroom it was packed with people its actually the ballroom from the end of the movie the fugitive remember so that ballroom so my mom and i walk in its packed with people the sorry the end where harrison ford as dr richard kimble bursts in to confront dr charles nichols right  so that ballroom so my mom and i walk in its packed with people why does kimble confront nichols well i know we all know this but no no but but but kimble he found out that nichols along with devlin macgregor and lentz who has mysteriously died they had hired frederick sykes the onearmed man to kill kimble kimbles wife wasnt even the target i know we all know this but they were gonna kill kimble because he wasnt gonna approve certain liver samples to pass  so kimble finds out about all of this and of course hes furious and he bursts into the ballroom and he goes you switched the samples and dr nichols is  ladies and gentlemen my friend dr richard kimble what accent did that guy have by the way he goes you switched the samples and you doctored your research so that you could have provasic anyway so its that ballroom so we walk into that ballroom it was packed with people it was packed with people a real whos not of chicago celebrities walter jacobson was there walter jacobson was the local fox anchor hed do fun things where hed go undercover as a homeless person and hed be  oh what time is the soup and theyd be  man youre walter jacobson he was there everybody and on the far side of the ballroom under a spotlight we saw a little bit of silver hair and it was him bill clinton the comeback kid but he was surrounded by reporters and photographers and secret service so what are you gonna do well if youre my mom you ball up the back of my sport coat and you push me forward  a human shield and then you start jogging while yelling this ten year old boy has to meet the next president of the united states kind of implying that i might be dying my feet were not on the ground she was swinging me  a snowplow i was just mowing down fat chicago democrats i pushed past all the reporters i pushed past all the photographers we pushed past all the secret service we land at bill clintons feet bill clinton turns looks at my mom and says hey ellen cause he never forgets a bitch ever my mom melts she goes hi bill then it is revealed that she has no plan so she pushes me towards clinton and she goes this is my son john and hes also going to be president and i was  what the hell are you talking about im not gonna be president and i know now that im definitely never gonna be president not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly based on my ten year old memory bill clinton is about  feet tall and he leaned down because well i was wearing this button that i bought outside the fundraiser it was a cartoon button of george h w bush and it had a quail flying over his head and it was shitting on his head and it said birdbrained and i thought it was very funny and bill clinton leaned down so that only i could hear and he said hey man i  your button and i said you can do whatever you want forever and he took my advice and it was the best night of my entire life and i got home that night i got home that night and my dad was still awake  reading angry under one lamp just  and i went up to him and i went hey im gonna be a democrat and im gonna vote for bill clinton and without looking up at me my dad just said you have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair  how you talk to a child so heres the end of that story that was  lets flash forward five years to  it is now  i am a sophomore in high school bill clinton is in his second term as president and on the morning that the monica lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of the new york times it had been on the drudge report and then it was on the cover of the new york times that morning i wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face i am a teenager asleep in bed and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach and i open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work and he says the other shoe just dropped and then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend bill clinton good night chicago your email address will not be published required fields

              " ['wow hey thank you thanks thank you guys hey seattle nice to see you look at this look at us were here this is crazy its insane so about five years ago pretty much everyone who i know started to get married and that was strange for me because i dont really believe in the idea of marriage and that would have been fine except i have a problem where sometimes when i think that i am right about something it can be a real source of tension between me and the person im arguing with and the reason its a source of tension is that im right and so i remember distinctly talking to my friend dana and she goes well you dont believe in marriage for you but of course you believe in it for other people and i was  no i think its insane  for anyone and she said whyand i said well first of all it just seems doomed   of marriages end in divorce thats just first marriages by the way second marriages  to  end in divorce third marriages  to  end in divorce thats a learning curvesecond of all monogamys impossible or at the very least not a sure thing when i say that i think people assume that im implying that men are incapable of being faithful i think women are just as incapable but for more sophisticated reasons  i mean with men were just really simple we have a very simple sexuality when i say that my female friends are  well we  sex just as much as you do and i said sure but its different and they say how and i say have you ever masturbated while driving a carnumber three im never gonna be happy why would anyone want to be a part of that i think thats not brought up often enough i  i didnt know that would be the reaction oh no thats the hopeful part the  i had one ally in all this which is my friend andy and hes a comedian as well not only did we decide we werent gonna get married we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married yeah we were pretty good at it  we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages  we were we were pretty good i mean we werent  the best in the world im sure there are better in europe but we were we were solid   so  for example at point my friend alex was about to get engaged and so we just took him to dinner and during dessert we gave him a long hard stare we said are you sure this is what you want to do and then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel  when we werent friends anymore so february   im at andys house in los angeles and earlier in the night i got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone and it was a bad one because i knew that i was right and andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation cause hes the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether youre right he says stuff  she sounds crazy  even if what shes saying isnt that crazy  youd be  she only eats whole wheat bagels hed be  she sounds crazy youd be  thats not even the crazy part  so im telling him about his argument and he goes youre right i go i know im right he goes yeah youre right i go i know im right i got to tell her about this in the morning and i get in my rental car to head back to my hotel and im driving out of andys small road and im tboned i dont know if youre familiar with this term  this is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car drivers side at a  angle  a tbone steak and in   seconds im spun around and i think im dead no wait im paralyzed and then i hear nothing and then i hear the other car skid out and drive away i know let me tell you how this argument started i met jenny in st louis my friend andy and i were working for her company they were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches which is really my demographic i  no i was very nervous about this i was actually kind of about to go onstage and i was  scrawling notes on my napkin a lot of times ill write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary and jenny looked at me and she goes what are you doing and i said im writing my set list and then she goes i think itll be fine and i was  no it wont be fine and then she was  i think it will be  and i said why do you think that and she said well you look so nervous i think theyll feel sorry for you but jenny has this really soft sweet voice  the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything at one point she said it seems  you comedians are a lot funnier onstage normally id be offended by that but in this instance i was  you are right that is a great point you are beautiful  she re she really was  from the moment i met jenny i knew i wanted to sleep with her at least once stay with me  i mean i mean that in  in the most meaningful way  that was the most that i was capable of in my life at that point i id jus id just come off a really long difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married and and then we werent and then when we werent i was so heartbroken i just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely  and but from the moment i met jenny i just wanted to be with her and i didnt i didnt think it was gonna happen  i dont have that kind of confidence i actually think of myself as a sex maybe which is to say that if im seeing a girl shed think id have sex with him maybe  and im im not ashamed of that there were periods in my life where i was a sex never or a sex with self always yeah and often surprisingly often yeah i just dont give off a great first impression  ill give you an example  this is the shirt i decided to wear tonight  i didnt i didnt spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt i mean this is my a outfit my b outfit was naked i  to dress down to perpetuate the myth that i might be a fixerupper ive reached this point in my life i dont really look in the mirror before i leave my apartment i glance at it to make sure im not bleeding  what i mean  but i dont stare at the mirror if i stare at the mirror i get angry  i feel  im complaining about a bad call a ref just made im  come on youre blind if youre leaving the house  that and the ref is god and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline and its a close game cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast and im all riled up im about to charge the field and the guy comes by with fried dough and im  next time  thats how i go for fried dough cause i have a problem i just this is ridiculous can you follow me over here for a second im gonna jump off stage this is only in seattle where someone is wearing no shoes no shoes or socks what who are you people what is wrong with you i would expect that behavior from this guy but not you sir not you what is this where do you think you are from seattle yeah seattle so ive been going  recently to a womens exercise class iive given up on having a traditional male physique and so now im going for strong independent woman and  its going pretty well  im not as good in the class as you might think sometimes ill kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isnt looking but then when she looks over i always have to strike a pose as though ive been doing what everybody else has been doing it reminds me of the olympics  how they do gymnastics how theyll have those the girls will do those crazy flips and twirls and every once in a while and im not saying i root for this to happen but sometimes theyll fall and its ugly cause theyre rolling around  im in a lot of trouble  i dont even know how i got here but at the end of that no matter what and i totally fall for it im  that cant possibly be the same loser from moments ago i mean thats a completely different person this person has much better posture for starters i really wanted jenny to come out with me and andy that night in st louis cause we were going out to one of these famous irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak and so i thought that might work to my advantage i dont know and  i didnt have the nerve to ask her myself and so i convinced andy to ask her for us and  pfft which yeah i dont know if that was the best idea cause  were heading were in the car heading to the pub and jenny says oh i left my id at the hotel and i was  oh we can just swing back and get it and shes  shes  no itll be fine i was  no it wont be fine cause its st patricks day and theres bouncers and she goes no itll be  and i was  no it wont be  and then we get to the pub and it was fine  the bouncer just kind of waved her through which has not been my experience with bouncers for me bouncers are  prison guards and for jenny theyre  birthday clowns   what can i do to make your day betteryou know and thats were at the pub and it had taken so much convincing for andy to get jenny to come out there by the time she came out she thought she was on a date with him and yeah that wasnt the idea and so i said i had to convince him to fall away as the night went on  the red rockets on the space shuttle and eventually she realized she was on a date with me and she was not happy about that but  but she warmed to me as the night went on cause she was drinking and then  no by the end of the night we were laughing and having a good time and we i caught a break which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends and she and i were stuffed in this little back seat together and it was really quiet so i could hear her soft voice and she told me she had just come off a long difficult breakup and i told her about my breakup and for a moment there in the back seat it felt  we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart and we get back to the hotel and i offer to walk her to her room and she says sure we get to her door and i didnt want this night to end and so i build up the courage to lean in to kiss her and she says oh no thank you which i thought was polite but disappointing i mean theres something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because youre really putting yourself out there youre just  i think we should connect mouths  and the other persons  i do not think we should connect mouths and those are theyre two very different mouth agendas  and then you just feel so stupid youre  i never should have suggested we connect mouths  this is a sore subject for me i have sort of a long history of failed kisses  i i remember growing up  when people started making out  in my time in massachusetts it was in seventh grade i remember i remember it  it was yesterday cause i was shocked i was  people we know are just making out with other people we know but how  it seemed  an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden i was  i am not doing that and collectively all the girls in my class were  that is fine you are not on the list youre not exactly a firstround draft pick for our new activity i was  perfect it seemed so gross to me and it still does kind of  sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from th',\n",
              "  'ese guys who are  i dont  when i see two dudes making out in the street and i feel that way about anyone  making out is just sloppy its  watching a dog eat spaghetti thats how i make out is that right does anybody know if thats right  good so in seventh grade i was  im not gonna make out with anybody and that was fine for a while but increasingly it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts it was  the makeout club and the nonmakeout club and these were informal organizations of course i mean i would be sad if that were schoolsanctioned  we call this meeting of the nonmakeout club to order first order of business nintendo second order of business why doesnt anyone  us meeting adjourned i dont know it was a sad group and we were losing good guys by the day i feared i feared that soon i would be the lone member of the nonmakeout club so i was  i got to try to get into the makeout club but it was a very intangible goal i didnt really talk to a lot of girls and there was one girl who sat in front of me in class named lisa bazetti who i had a huge crush on but she was way out of my league  she had many suitors she had i dont the rest of the show is in old english  she doth had many suitors  no she had many  admirers and there were three of us really and i was in third place in all the trade publications but i had one advantage over these other guys which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework thanks to alphabetical order bazetti birbiglia one time i said something on the phone that made her laugh and i was  oh this is great i got to do that more and one time we were on the phone and she was laughing so hard i remember so well cause she goes mike you got to stop im gonna pee myself and i was  wow this was the closest id ever come to a vagina so spent the next  years trying to get lisa bazetti to pee and thats how i ended up here yeah thats how we all ended up here in a sense so  so heres what happened with lisa one time i built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me and she said yes i couldnt believe it  all of a sudden i thought well maybe this will be  one of those romantic comedy montages well go to the carnival well get stuck on the top of the ferris wheel well make out itll all take a minute and a half and it will be set to phil collins song but i think that when youre  years old you just dont understand certain things about your digestive system you dont know that you shouldnt eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler cotton candy being the most insane of these items its basically saying were gonna take sugar which everyone knows is bad but then well dress it up  insulation and im  im not sure what the selling point is there is it the sugar or the insulation theyre  we already sold it im  well done way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates i dont know if you have the scrambler here in seattle i imagine you might it travels on a truck it is a very mobile scrambling unit the premise is very simple you just sit on a twoperson pod with the person you are in love with and that pod goes in a circle which is part of a larger circle which is part of an even grander circle as i understand it it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients it was called the shits of pantserator and it was wildly successful and then it was coopted by the carnival workers of america cwoa and they said they said we  it but we do feel  the name is a little bit of a turnoff and then one guy says well what about the i think im gonna dieerator and theyre  thats good cause it gets across the essence of how you feel when youre on the machine plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea which is a nice homage to the original intention of the machine but we still feel  the name might be a little bit of a turnoff and then one guy goes well what about the scrambler cause it scrambles you theyre  we get it frank but who frank is a maniac this guy cant be stopped but every once in a while hes got a good idea but who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment and this one guy goes well i have a nephew whos  years old and smokes pot  hours a day i feel  he might be available and theyre  he sounds amazing we dont even need to interview him he sounds completely qualifiedi sit down with lisa on the scrambler and im feeling good  shes snuggling up close to me and im thinking im thinking  this could be it this could be where its all gonna happen this is very special and then they put that bar seat belt down and the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment its not a ralph nader approved item i dont think its saved lives i think the only thing its ever done is in a scrambler accident its just sort of held someones esophagus down to the pavement making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident first rule of scrambler accident dont talk about scrambler accident thats from scrambler club well i knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that i was going to throw up for sure and i even said to the  stoner i was  hey actually and then he was gone apparently he doesnt enjoy the second halves of sentencesso then im scrambling and as i am scrambling im thinking i need to come up with a plan of some kind im not going down without a fight my first plan was very simple it was just dont look at lisa dont look at any other people i was  dont look at lisa dont look at any other people dont look at lisa dont look at any other people i need a new plan and the new plan was i needed to tell the scrambler operator that he needed to stop the ride but the mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window so im  i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride please stop the ride and im back im not sure he heard me i got to say it louder please stop the ride im not sure hes paying attention i think he might be smoking pot right now the third time i said please stop and then i started throwing up and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler just popcorn peanuts insulation really insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa i did not look at lisa but im pretty sure she was staring at me because i was a spectacle at that point i was spectacular and we did not make out i did not lose my mouth virginity that evening two years later it gets worse  im at the st johns high school what they call a cattle call dance this is an all boys catholic school i attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty st johns gymnasium  cattle which is a friendly way to describe women  so cattle shows up at  well make out with the cattle cattle goes home at  then we go out for burgers completely separate from the cattle analogy it was a horrible affair it was just  this room chockfull of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out at this point i was indeed the lone member of the nonmakeout club but it was actually worse than that cause i had to lie to my friends and tell them i had had my first kiss cause it was  this really tough all boys school and so when they would ask  oh have you had your first kiss id be  yeah  all the time  every every week i always feared at some point thered be a followup question  oh yeah whats it  and id be  yeah  its just  licking an ice cream cone and theyd be  no its not its  sucking on a rocket pop and id be  ah wrong frozen dessert analogy im at the dance and im flanked by my friend sam ricciardi and were introduced by our friend tom to these girls from his town they were the last two cows at the dance they were  moo and we were  moo and then sam says one of these phrases i think weve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat he says you get that one which i know its the worst turn of phrase but im comfortable saying it cause i know ive been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me you get that one and then her friend goes  oof  or even worse or even worse  you owe me which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance i would hate to hurt someones credit score  so he goes he goes you get that one and then im just fast dancing with this girl sandra to young mcs bust a move and im not great at fast dancing but they had the strobe light going so its only catching me one out of every five hey so shes losing interest but at  the speed and then im saved by a slow song stairway to heaven which is a classic makeout anthem led zeppelin eight minutes long whats great about slow dancing is you cant really mess it up cause its just sort of a slowmotion hug  the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it shed be  what are you doing and id be  i dont pick up on social cues  but its such a long song  stairway so im just trying not to fidget im sort of a fidgety person i feared if i fidgeted too much i might initiate the head tilt too early i didnt know anything about making out but id seen people do it i could see theres  a head tilt i had heard there were tongues involved and i could see that there was  some kind of space in between the two mouths to me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing what is happening in that space there is no  theres no video documentation of that area its  the giant squid of making out no one has seen it alive theyve only seen it washed up on the shore which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy but so im trying not to fidget then with   minutes left in stairway to heaven the song hits that crescendo all around me kids start to make the tilt just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me and i was  oh no i dont want to be alone anymore and i make the slightest tilt and then sandra comes in strong and then its an allout mouth war and she had artillery cause she had braces it was  a dog eating spaghetti and the fork as this oral atrocity is taking place all i can think is im not alone anymore im not in the nonmakeout club and all i wanted to do was tell my friends but i couldnt because up until that point id lied and said that id had my first kiss i walked off the dance floor sam was  howd it go dude i had to be  same as always pretty smooth as the week wore on i started to convince myself well maybe it did go well and i should call sandra and this could bud into a relationship of some kind but i got her number from tom and those conversations ended up being very brief  we didnt have a lot to talk about i remember just being  hey you  full house me neither cool all right later  what i mean at certain points i remember getting this vibe from her ',\n",
              "  'kind of  why are you calling me and i remember thinking oh im probably reading into that one too much and and then she stopped calling me back and i was  oh yeah i read into that one perfectly but i just felt so dumb about the whole thing and the worst part is i couldnt even tell my friends until one day i was i was standing by my locker with my friend tom and so i said to him i was  hey whats going on with sandra  she hasnt called me back and tom has this knowing grin on his face i was  what tom was  nothing and i was  what tom was  nothing and i was  what toms  oh i talked to sandra and she said youre the worst kisser shes ever kissed and it was so devastating cause not only was it probably true but i couldnt explain to my friends why it was true i couldnt say that makes sense ive never done that before so instead i had to play it off i had to be  yeah that sounds about right im a terrible kisser thats kind of my thing so i lean in to kiss jenny and she says oh no thank you she agrees to go out with me in new york we were both living in new york and she gave me her number and i typed it in my phone and from that point on she would be jen irish pub nice a few weeks later i took her out to a restaurant i couldnt afford to show her how much money i could put on my credit card were out to dinner and she says to me she goes everyone hates me at work and i said why would they hate you i love you she goes you love me i go i mean you seem cool i pulled it back i didnt want to show all my cards just about nine of them one of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said  sometimes ill date two people at once and that way im never let down by either person i said that seems  a really smart plan  id  to do that as well and she said im still kind of seeing my exboyfriend john and you can see other people too but you have to tell me if youre seeing them and i was  all right sounds  a plan got it break i got to go find some more people  and so a few nights later im in another city and i do a show and after the show i went out to a bar and i ended up making out with this random girl then a few nights later im out to dinner with jenny and she says how was your trip and i said it was great i did some shows and then one night i ended up making out with this random girl and that didnt go over very well in the conversation i could sense that something was wrong and i was  but im right about that right  im supposed to tell you if that happens right and she says yeah but it doesnt mean that i wont lose interest in you and i said thats a whole new clause thats a twist what is this the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects i said are you still seeing john and she said sometimes i said well dont you see the contradiction in that and she says yes and it gets very quiet because we were falling in love three weeks into my relationship with jenny i built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to bermuda i wanted to show her how much more money i could put on my credit card since i didnt have a lot left we went to bermuda cause it was the off season you can get these great deals online because as it turns out when its winter in new york it is also winter in bermuda and  jenny and i meet up at the airport and shes late which is a big pet peeve of mine i fancy myself as a professional traveler im always two hours early i have my pocket for my ticket and my passport and i have laceless moccasins i never tell jokes about bombs and and jennys late and then we get to security and im not making this up she doesnt have a license or a passport and i said what do you mean i go how do you travel and she goes well usually they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work id i dont  to dwell on the differences between men and women but i just cant imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport and they would let him on the plane but women get a pass on things  this that i find completely bewildering i mean if i were in charge of alqaeda for example what what i would do is i would recruit attractive women because theyre just not stopped under any circumstances although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the  virgins and  the women wouldnt want that unless theyre lesbians although theres an idea  alqaeda alqaeda could recruit hot lesbians although then theyd have to guarantee that the  virgins are also lesbians i mean what are the odds  all  virgins are also lesbians unless you think of sexuality as  a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity  the  virgins are  i didnt even know i was a lesbian until i had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist and now thats all im into i used to be into these afghani guys who are so crazy theyd die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me and  of my friends but now i dont see khalid in the same way anymore the point is we went to bermuda and were on the flight on the flight and the flight attendant comes over and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us and she says congratulations on your honeymoon and we said oh no thanks were not on our honeymoon and she walks away and jenny says thats so funny i dont think ill ever go on a honeymoon and i said oh really and she goes yeah i dont think id ever want to get married in my life and i said oh really i go me too i said is that based on a principle or did you have a bad relationship  what was your first boyfriend  and she told me about her first boyfriend brian it was they were at the same bus stop when they were  and they would make out on the bus and they were together for six years and they  their relationship got deeper and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together and i said then what and she said he died he had leukemia and i said well do you ever talk about this with anyone and she says no i dont really  to talk about it but these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where jenny was opening up to me and i was opening up to her and every night wed be up till  or  in the morning and we were so happy we at one point i was  well we should do this again we should go on another trip and you could get a license or a passport jenny said that sounds great but i dont think id get a license or a passport cause they dont make me get one and i was  yeah but its the law  jenny says yeah i dont think ill get one cause they dont make me get one  thats how i feel thats how jenny argues things sometimes shell just say thats how i feel and ill say thats not an argument  were not even in an argument right now because you dont have an argument and shell say i just won that argument and ill say thats not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is and shell say i just won that argument again thats how i feel you could see how this could be a little bit maddening   on our final day on the trip we got into an argument about essentially nothing she noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel and she said we should play and i was  yeah but not  a game and she said why and i said well cause id win and she said no i think i would win i go no i know that id win and i know that what im supposed to say is that the guy says ill win the girl says ill win and the guy lets her win and then she likes him more but i just dont have that in me and jenny goes you dont have to let me win lets go out and play and so we went out and played basketball and i just kicked her ass i mean it was just  it was just   to    to  i mean i was having a good day but still i was just destroying her and at one point she literally said ive never met someone whos so obsessed with the score and i said the score is what makes it a game so were arguing this over lunch and then again it comes up at dinner and then were still arguing about it at  or  in the morning about essentially nothing and she said i dont understand why youre so obsessed with being right i go im not obsessed with it i just am i said why do you think youre right and she says thats how i feel i said if you think im so wrong about everything why are you even with me and jenny says you cant choose who you love which is true but it doesnt mean its good i remember the first time i fell in love i was in high school and it was that first time where you fall in love and youre just  this is it i found her im  years old and im done  and her name was amanda and she was  adorable and funny and what was really exciting for me was that she was  a delinquent  i was  this playbytherules school citizen and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid which i thought was a really strong quality  at one point she was  it was totally messed up because it wasnt even me it was this other girl and i was framed and i was just  awesome  no one would ever frame me for anything i just i thought it was  an opposites attract situation she wanted to know what it was  to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper and i wanted to know what it was  to be cool at one point i was  do you want to write an article for the newspaper she goes i dont want to write an article i want to do things people write articles about and i was  good answeri find that when you fall in love you tend to overlook certain red flags one of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me but then she would pull it back shed be  no one likes you at all only kidding or  youre  a nerd but youre not even smart just joking cant choose who you lovesecond red flag with amanda was that she was a liar and i dont i dont mean that in an offensive way  lying was kind of  a its  a sport at the school i was at i transferred from the all boys school to this coed school there was this one guy in my class named keith robbins who was a legendary liar youd know when he was lying cause he would lick his finger  a bookie and he would dart his eyes from side to side and hed go yeah yeah nice nice  and he wasnt even handling money  i dont even know what this is about and then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant hed be  yeah my uncles tony robbins motivational speaker yeah nice  and we found out that that wasnt even true but even if that were true that wouldnt be impressive to a bunch of high school students but i think thats the jedi level of lying is you lie about little stuff and no one notices when youre lying about big stuff its  bankingthe final red flag with amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend i know im in the future also i think we can all see now cause were so smart and mikes so dumb and   i can also see in retrospect thats a much bigger red flag than i perceived it to be at the time but i was so excited she was even with me at all and she said she had ',\n",
              "  'another boyfriend at home but they were in the process of breaking up but it was a bad time cause his parents were sick and so i tried to be understanding of that  i went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents and i thought well this is the affirmation that i need im gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend and i drive my moms station wagon to amandas parents house and i walk in the front door and theres amanda and theres her parents and its going well and a few hours go by and this other guy comes over to the house and his name is scott im assuming hes  a family friend or a relative and slowly im noticing similarities between scott and things that amanda has said about her other boyfriend theyre both in their first year in college and theyre competitive wrestlers and its dawning on me that im hanging out with my girlfriends boyfriend and its going pretty well i mean he he seemed  a nice guy i could totally see what she saw in him there was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom she would hold on to my hand and she would say i wish it were just you and me here and i remember thinking you could make that happen the way she said it was as though she werent involved in the decision process  id love to but the boys in corporatewell the day took an even stranger turn when scott suggested that we go hang out at his house and i met his parents it is indescribable meeting your girlfriends boyfriends parents for the first time part of you is angry for obvious reasons but then part of you still wants to make a good impression  youre  maybe if this goes well shell see that im good with adults in general as a side note his parents seemed in perfect health at one point his dad even said to me how do  amanda and i said were just friends from school and i was so ashamed and i felt so dumb and i drove home and i remember thinking i am never gonna let this happen to me again so ten months into my relationship with jenny she invites me to meet her parents and this was a tricky time at this point our relationship was intense but casual which is a dangerous relationship cocktail and it was a hard thing to organize cause i was away probably five days out of the week and so we found a sunday where i was coming back from a fiveday stint in texas which was awful cause it was in texas and i thats thats not to say i dislike texas entirely its such a large thing to dislike and  but that week it felt  texas just disliked me and i just kind of disliked texas back to the point where i developed a small drinking problem which is which is very popular in texas i was performing at a comedy club now comedy i love comedy clubs cause theyre sort of a highlow entertainment proposition  in some ways though theyre the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word and then some of them sell dildo straws   theres  bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends and theyre handing out gummy penises or whatever thats thats actually a thing i didnt even realize that i didnt realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was was the gummy quality of the penis i feel  if i were in charge of the candification of the penis it would be hard candy and then if and then if you suck it down to the gummy part then you just sort of put that off to the side but i but thats thats not my job im  i leave that to the experts but i just i just do the comedy part but i was performing at this club all week and after the late show saturday night i was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things and id been drinking all week and  i always try to be a team player  so i was  whatever i can do to help i dont see how this could end badly and  the next morning i wake up in the my hotel room and im hung over and im groggy and i roll out of bed and i run to the airport to catch my flight im still two hours early and i land in new york and i get a cab to jennys parents house and i walk in the front door and theres jenny and theres her parents and theres her other sort of exboyfriend john and he wasnt front and center  he was just kind of around  he was in the pool  wading and doing laps  that kind of thing but i pulled jenny aside i was  well whats john doing here and she says well he and i arent still together but when we were together he became friends with my stepdad and hes been staying here at their house the last couple weeks and i said  thats not good i feel  that gives him the edge jennys staring at me and i said what she says you have a hickey on your neck and i said i dont think thats true and then i glance at the mirror next to me and realize that in fact i do have a hickey on my neck and i say im really sorry and she says where is that from and i said there was this bachelorette party and i was drunk that sentence never comes out right i mean theres no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even  and we start arguing and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment i didnt have a leg to stand on i was  well what about john what was he doing there she said you have a hickey on your neck i said yeah but at least i told you the truth and she said eventually and i said eventually is better than never and then she kneed me in the balls i dont know if youve ever experienced this before im sure half of you have not  its  being electrocuted except you dont get to die its  you want to die but you cant and theres a person in your face saying you deserve this which they wouldnt even do in electrocutions i think they would deem that as inhumane\\xa0 even in texasjenny says i think that we should just break up  its not just this i mean youre away a lot of the time and even when youre here you work at night and i work in the day i just dont think its gonna work out and i said \\xa0 and we were apart for about six months and i missed her so much but i kept resisting calling her cause i wanted to give her space and every once in a while id get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from jen irish pub nice and it would just say hi and id write back hi it was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another but i think in some ways kept us together and finally on new years i caved in and i called her i said hey i really miss you and i want to see you and we got together for coffee and we hit it off just  we used to and we decided we would get back together we had a great period there  i took her to get a license and a passport first we went for her social security card and then we took that to the dmv and then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport it was  the triple crown of identifications jenny was wildly identifiable one night she was heading back from my apartment to hers and she stops and i said what and she says i think that we should live together and i said no i really dont think thats a good idea  ive just decided  as a principle im not gonna get married or live with someone its not personal and she said well unless we live together i just dont think its gonna work out cause we just dont see each other enough and i dont think that we stand a chance thats how i feel so we moved in together and one day jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends and she invites me to come along and i said oh no thanks that doesnt go over so well she says why and i said well as  i dont believe in marriage and so i dont buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it she said well what do you believe in and i said i dont know she said well if you dont believe in anything how can you not believe in marriage and i said well first of all  it just doesnt seem necessary i mean is it  marriage is an archaic institution invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property i dont want to be a part of that second of all i dont even think we have a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is i mean one of me and andys friends was about to get engaged and we were skeptical and we said are you sure this is the person you want to be with for the rest of your life and he goes yeah i think so and we said well what if she gets in a car accident and shes disfigured would you stay with her then and he said maybe that is not an acceptable answer third of all if im so in love why does it need to be written into a government contract and im not one of these  i dont want government up in my business kind of people i think the government does a nice job delivering the mail and suggesting i dont eat poison but i just dont understand why they need to be involved in my personal relationships then finally if marriage is religious shouldnt i believe in the religion ive been to more weddings of my friends where the people on the altar dont believe in the religion of the church theyve invited us to some of them even go to classes with the priest in advance to more elaborately lie about believing in a religion they dont believe in just to have a wedding in a fancy building that is insane thats how i feel so i explain this to jenny and jenny says well if you ever did want to get married i would marry you and i said why arent you listening to any of this and jenny says thats how i feel at this point it was  in the morning wed been arguing all night and we hadnt slept i had to catch a flight at  am out of newark airport to los angeles for a show i was doing that night at this point im overtired and im angry and im late im stuffing my things in my roller suitcase and i walk out of our apartment its  am that part of the morning before the earth even exists before they program the matrix or whatever you walk out of your apartment part of the road isnt even there theres a guy with a laptop going we need a road stat whats the code for building tank  and i get to the airport the news hasnt even started yet its just an anchor looking around  what are you up to and i get to the kiosk and i print up my ticket and i bring it to the security lady and she looks at me and she goes well that aint your gate  i guess they changed the gate but the way she said it was as though i had participated in the decision of changing it i was  i was not involved in this process i wasnt even ccd  as though i had gone to the kiosk and been    hell im flying out of  and then i photoshopped my own ticket printed it out and been  this is where im going  im not that aggressive as a traveler so i was  well where is this gate she goes its in another terminal you got to take a tram she points to the tram and i start walking my roller suitcase and i hear her say and you better run  i guess i was late at that point so i started running and the roller suitcase does not enjoy running the roller suitcase was  i dont want to run i have wheels and i was  i dont want to run e',\n",
              "  'ither but this is what we have to do i tell you what when we get to the hotel ill walk you in circles for a few hours then i i get to the tram and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives and it says zero minutes i was  perfect thats exactly how long i want to wait but the trams riding away i was  thats  minute then it says ten minutes and im experiencing that psychological downward spiral  oh great im gonna miss my flight and then im gonna miss every flight from now on and im gonna miss my family reunion and then im not gonna have a family and then im gonna be a crack whore and its  all of a sudden im a crack whore just because i miss this one flight i can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time andi get on the next tram ten minutes later and i run to the gate and im sweaty and im out of breath but im on time and im so relieved that i sit down in a chair at the gate and i fall asleep and i wake up to the sound of the door shutting i jump up and the door is closed and i am on the sad side of the door the happy side has an airplane and a pilot the sad side is me and the cinnabon lady normally id be very excited if it were just me and the cinnabon lady im a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year i think thats an effective use of time but in this instance i needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane and the cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community i was  do  these people she was  all i know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun i ran up to the giant glass window i started pounding on the window  in a romantic comedy i was  drew barrymores character come back she didnt come back and i missed my flight i got on the next one they could get me on there was a stopover in texas  how i feel about texas and  i get to los angeles late that night and id missed my show id never missed one of my shows before and im so angry and jennys calling me but im not picking up the phone cause im blaming this entire day on her i get back to my friend andys house and i said andy this relationship is messing up my entire life and andy goes youre right i go i know im right he goes yeah youre right i go i know im right i got to tell her about this in the morning i drive out of andys small road and im tboned thats the culinary way of describing it in   seconds im spun around and i think im dead no wait im paralyzed and then i hear nothing then i hear the other car skid out and drive away  minutes later im sitting on a curb at this point the police have arri have arrived as well as my friend andy and thats when i start crying  how when you drop a baby on the ground it doesnt doesnt start crying right away because it doesnt understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face and then its  oh i guess i should be doing something that matches that waah im crying because im looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that in that moment i might have ceased to exist  i said earlier i dont really believe in anything so in my mind that would have been the end of all things id experienced in my life every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion and the officer comes over and he says what happened and i said i got hit by this car and then i heard nothing and then i heard the other car skid out and drive away the officer points over to the light the other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree i cant help but think thats karma thats a hit and run and hit and then the officer puts this form in my face and he goes sign this and i said well what does it mean and he goes it means youre  and that we can leave i was really shaken up i was  i dont know if im  and he goes just sign it which is a very unattractive quality when someone just repeats a command that youve just said no to and its unattractive but very effective  i signed it andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution but we have to wait two hours cause the other driver had beat us there and eventually were with the doctor and andy says to him he goes well was the other guy drunk and the doctor says well i cant answer that and andy says was he he uses the technique we had learned earlier and it works  the doctor says well hes heading to jail now and andy and i flash each other a look  the hardy boys  case closed a few hours later were back at andys house its probably around  in the morning and i have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have neardeath experiences i say i need to call jenny and tell her that we need to get married and andy says mike sleep on it and i said no no no this makes perfect sense and i pick up my phone and i dial her number and he puts his hand over the phone and he says mike sleep on it he saves me the next morning i fly back to new york and a few weeks later i get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that i just described and it had found me at fault and that i owed and im not making this up  for the repairs on the other drivers mercedes suv and i was  well this cant be happening i explained to the woman i think its a misunderstanding the other guy was clearly drunk it was definitely not my fault and she said im really sorry but unless they change the accident report you owe this money so i requested the accident report and im gonna show you the actual accident report tonight i dont know if youve ever seen one of these things before but its a little bit  homework for cops and officer timson not so good with the homework he consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two vehicle one and vehicle two at one point so badly that he says  thats me started to go but all of a sudden  thats me also came at a high rate of speed crashing into him now im pretty selfdestructive as a person but i would never crash into my own car with my own car nor would i understand how you could do that this part is even crazier the other drivers statement at the scene of the accident was i was on venice going  im not too sure i was going away from the beach i was driving i dont know what happened did i hurt anyone i dont know where i was going but i came from home i had a sip of beer which is really everyones favorite quantity of beer just the one sip right thats what they serve these days at the homebeachpubso all of its mine the officer makes one key mistake he checks the box that finds me at fault so im  i need to get officer timson on the phone so we can clear up this misunderstanding the problem is he keeps ducking my calls and i know cause im calling two or three times a day leaving messages calling departments next to his department so he knows im trying to reach him and finally after a month of this i get him on the phone and im so relieved and i explain this misunderstanding and he listens to me and he says do the right thing and pay for the guys car i know and i mean thats what i said i go arent you listening to any of this i go and this guy was clearly drunk i mean he nearly killed me inches from where he hit and i would be dead right now and he wants me to pay for his car dont you see how crazy that is just as one human being to another and he says do the right thing and pay for the guys car and he hangs up the phone and at this point this stops being about money and its just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law this is chinatown so i started printing up google maps of the scene of the accident and california state driving law im on the phone with lawyers and private investigators theres only one lawyer who would consider the case and he was an accident lawyer and he said did you have any loss of income from the accident and i said no and he says did you have any loss of income from the accident and i said no this isnt about money and he doesnt take the case and this is when i start going completely madim up to about  or  am every night just surfing the web i get a subscription to a site called netdetectivecom which is a great site for vigilantes who have  so now i know this guys name i know where he lives i know what he does for a living and in my mind it becomes  a trailer for a revenge thriller  jim bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this but jim bosworth had another thing coming mike birbiglia i was  im gonna track down jim bosworth im gonna sue jim bosworth and im gonna sue the entire los angeles police department at this point people stopped talking to me entirely my friends would call me  hey whats going on id be  ill tell you whats going on id tell them this whole story and theyd be  you should get a lawyer id be  this is way past lawyers a lawyer wouldnt even touch this cause he wouldntthe only person who would talk to me at this point was jenny one night we were out to dinner at a restaurant and shes talking to me but im not listening cause im writing down ideas i have for the case on my napkin ive drawn out a diagram of the intersection and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in the laws the other driver broke and the phone numbers im gonna call that week and im so angry im writing over my own handwriting to the point where im ripping through the napkin and jenny looks at me and she says what are you doing and i said well this is my case and she says well why dont you work on that in the morning and i said well which part of this napkin dont you understand jenny says mike youre right but its only hurting you and im just so glad that youre alive and i think that we should focus on that she only has to say it once and i give up the case and i pay for this guys car july   jenny and i went to city hall and got married i still didnt believe in the idea of marriage and i still dont but i believe in her and ive given up on the idea of being right thank you guys very much thank you thank you guys so much thanks for coming here tonight and joining me epic your email address will not be published

              " ['    ladies and gentlemen make some noise for ronny chieng     thank you thank you hawaii im turning  so im harvesting my wifes eggs this year im harvesting my wifes eggs so that we can make embryos so we can freeze the embryos so that we do not have to have kids right now because kids are what you have when youve given up on your own hopes and dreams  im still trying here i look at my friends who are my age who have kids and they all look  shit  its gotten to the point where i cant even take a photo with them and post it on my main grid because it messes up the aesthetics of my instagram too much with their fucking haggard faces just drooping wrinkly crowsfeetembedded heads receding hairlines just withering graying hair coming out in clumps because of their children  i did a show and someone i went to high school with in singapore came to the show and after the show i met up with them and they brought another person with them and i was  oh is this other person your mom thank you so much for bringing your mother to my show and that other person was also someone i went to high school with  thats how fucking ugly  these people have become because of their children just unrecognizable so im trying to use money and science to push the curve back a little bit and  first step of harvesting my wifes eggs is i have to inject my wife twice a day for two weeks so i have to inject my wife i am the one injecting my wife twice a day for two weeks zero medical training i was given no medical training whatsoever the government lets you do this the the doctor asked me to do it the doctor was  hey have you ever held a needle before no perfect here take this and inject your wife in the middle of her body  nicolas cage in the rock  twice a day for two weeks with chemicals that we mail to you mystery chemicals that we send to your house in unmarked brown boxes just trust us that its the right thing that youre injecting into the person you love the most internet chemicals that show up it comes in a powder i have to make it into a liquid you understand its a meth lab in my kitchen as im mixing the comp im sweating the whole time cause im scared ill fuck up the measurements and kill my wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely then you have to  the air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements and then you have to put it in the syringe then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude   what youre doing   i dont know what im doing i saw someone do this on doogie howser   i dont even know the angle to put it into her   it looks so painful going in  i love my wife so much i cant even bear to watch her in pain i couldnt even bear to watch the needle go into her i had to inject my wife  this i had to  cover my eyes and  backhand it  into her  kurosawa  did i get the middle of your body no  just walk into the needle  im supposed to do all the work here meet me halfway and  the doctor said if you do everything right if you measure correctly you inject at the right times they scan  this part of her body  that chicago bulls logo right and they were   if you do everything right based on what we can tell you should expect  eggs  and my wife ended up getting   yeah always a  yeah always  a late halfhearted response to  usually the women in the crowd are  whoo yeah all the men in the crowd are always   is that a good number is  a good number of eggs how many eggs equal one bebe is it four eggs is one bebe so  eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together let me put this in a language that men can understand  twentysix eggs from one vagina in one cycle is mvp numbers  twentysix eggs is  if magic johnson averaged the tripledouble and killed his own aids   thats the level of medical miracle thats happening in whatever this part of my wifes body that horn of the bull that  curls into itself the doctor  scraped out  eggs out of my wifes vagina  salmon roe just scooping out just dripping out and then you put it in some nigiri right and then you eat it thats how babies are made you gotta salt bae the eggs onto the ikura and then you eat it so  were trying to make embryos so eggs thats just half the equation i dont know if  how embryos are made but eggs thats just half of it she did her part admirably so now i have to contribute my half of the embryo equation so im sitting in the doctors office   a wet pigeon all right and the doctor comes over and the doctors a woman because of course she is shes  good morning mr chieng so  whens the last time you ejaculated my wife is right here and shes  yeah when is the last time you ejaculated  we would all  to know its the one time in life where youre not allowed to lie about jerking off its when a medical professional is asking you a direct question and its for reproduction its for the intended purpose so you gotta tell the truth so im  whatever ill tell the truth  let me check my calendar   i guess the last time i ejaculated was  let me see  yesterday around  pm  and my wife is  yesterday i was with you all day  and i was  yeah but remember when you took out the trash   because i also put up mvp numbers against a shot clock and heavy defensive pressure but i was thinking of you the whole time its really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever vietnamese people eat my wife is vietnamese ive no idea what the fuck she eats nước mắm  and i went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off its the medical jerkingoff room every hospital has a medical jerkingoff room  its nondescript not a lot of signage smaller than i think it should be lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt and im sitting in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and theres grown men outside the door waiting for me to finish  so they too can use the medical jerkingoff room that we are sharing  a wework  and im in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and i couldnt go  sorry sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand im sorry sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me sorry sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters as they code to death painfully and the families crying in the waiting room wasnt turning me on  so i couldnt go i couldnt go so i just call  right im    im  these people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room  i call the doctor back in and im  doc i cant go  i cant medically ejaculate under these circumstances the vibes are off let me go home let me go home to medically ejaculate can i do that and the doctors  yeah you can go home but  as soon as it comes out of your body it expires quicker than avocados in hawaii  youve got  you have  a  window before theres  an exponential decreasing probability of  im   fine ill go home ill medically ejaculate ill come back in  minutes no problem so i go home open the front door ejaculate immediately  this is   this is home court advantage i know where everything is i know whats behind me i look at the dripping garbage bag  its  a pavlovian response at this point  i ejaculate into a cup  its a cup that they gave me its not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen  that says worlds best dad on it  its the cup that they use doctors give you to test your pee for drugs its got a really tight cap right so i ejaculate into the cup it keeps overflowing so i gotta keep  pouring it out  just overwhelming amounts  its  ghostbusters  up in here   i fill it to the brim and then i scrape off the top and then i and then i seal the cap as tight as i can right get it really nice and tight and then i i put it inside my tshirt next to my skin under my armpit nice and snug because the doctor told me to do that because apparently  the titanic your body heat will keep your people alive and then i run downstairs and i jump into a new york city taxi and im  take me to langone hospital please hurry up the taxi driver is  what the fuck are you doing with your hand are you  im  oh yeah no im fine

it and  in the same motion without even putting it down she  alleyoops my jizz into my wifes eggs right just takes it and she goes boom shakalaka and  my sperm goes into my wifes eggs and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg nobody knows its a mystery its a mystery of the universe nobody knows when sperm goes into the egg its unknowable ooh its its  the event horizon on a black hole no one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes nothing happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes it becomes a bubble tea  nobody knows where bubble tea comes from its tapioca the sperm goes into the egg and then you shake it and you go to vegas you throw it on the crap table and if youre lucky if you get a good dice roll right it becomes a blastocyst thats what we call future humans blastocysts it becomes embryos the doctor shell take all the embryos and shell look at them under the microscope and shell grade the embryos  cocaine  shell be  ooh yeah these ones these are agrade embryos right here   these ones these are these are bgrade embryos so so i dont know  these these ones these are cgrade embryos  oh and these ones yeah these these are these are dgrade embryos yeah these these will storm the capitol someday  so  you dont want that and then  and then you have to  draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics and you dont know youre just projecting data you just hope youre not throwing away a tom brady in the  round thats going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you cant measure the human spirit and  we all  to think were good people in this room but were all picking the agrade embryos  no one here is not picking your agrade embryos if given a choice even if you were a bgrade embryo  you would still pick your agrade embryos because youll be  i know what its  im not putting my kids through this bgrade human existence with sweaty palms and sciatica  give me the agrade shit give me the best we could do give my kid a fighting chance and it got me thinking about the future a little bit because i never wanted kids i never thought i would have kids the only thing i ever wanted to do my whole life was this standup comedy in america  its the best look at this its the best you are cheering because  this is way better than having kids   so much more fun and lucrative well the blastocysts are real now theres eight of them waiting for me in the cloud   chance of successful implantation with gradea embryos so i guess that makes me a mass murderer in alabama it got me thinking about the future what kind of parent am i gonna be am i gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were or am i gonna be better than my parents were be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck youre supposed to be now and thinking about it turns out im gonna be just as bad as my parents were i can i can feel it i can feel it inside me i can feel the i can feel the chinese inside me i can just feel that high expectation just low tolerance for excuses its in here its right in here its  the default app  you cant delete the calculator app theres no x when you shake it theres no x you can move it off the home screen but its still in the os embedded  in the operating system i can feel the chinese if my blastocyst was real if it entered this reality and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever oh my god look at this blastocyst everybody look look at how beautiful this blastocyst is i love you so much blastocyst i love you much more than i thought i would  and your blastocyst is hugging you back right theyre   i love you too daddy daddy daddy when i grow up i want to be a standup comedian just  you  i just feel the chinese coming on right i just  you take your glasses off  hitler in the bunker  standup comedy are you out of your fucking mind  thats not even a real job what do you think is gonna happen just gonna run around america and tell jokes to strangers who dont give a fuck about your mental health and even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds and make it to even a semiprofessional level as a standup comedian do you think theres any chance in hell youll be funnier than me    dad is a borderline arena act in some markets have you seen my imdb page im in everything i will fucking crush your career osoto gari your mother and i just spent a fortune to make an agrade blastocyst for them to become a bgrade comedian i will never watch anything you do go to law school   is what my father said to me  i do think its tough for straight men in  to sincerely look up selfimprovement on the internet without five weeks later storming the capitol  that mens selfhelp youtube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now  im not saying its the biggest problem in the world clearly but it is a problem  because men were genetically predisposed to seek selfimprovement  were trying to be better people every day believe it or not women  once we hit a certain age  usually we die before then through suicide or environmental factors bmx biking dietary choices but if you can live long enough as a man you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective  you start seeking guidance from outside sources you start looking at watches   every man in this room has or will at some point weve all been there guys weve all done this weve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives and weve been  what a fucking piece of shit  i fucking hate this loser look at this loser fuck this loser i hate this person i need to be a better person let me start by getting fit   let me work on my health that seems  a logical place to start my journey let me control what i can control in here so what do you do as a man you go on youtube right you look up how to lift weights right you press enter you click on the first video its some guy doing kettlebell swings right hell teach you how to lock your core so you dont break your fucking spine and then you do that for two days you feel pretty good about yourself  whoo right and on the third day the same youtube channel has a new video notification alert the men are  whats this new video from kettlebellswinging guy what could he be doing in his new video in the video the kettlebellswinging guy hes doing the new kettlebell exercise the lawnmower hes doing that and then   seconds into the video he just suddenly just stops and he looks really sad and he puts the kettlebell down and he looks straight into the camera and hes  yo guys just real talk for a second all right  kettlebells are great but i just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind  and all the men watching this are  yeah  yeah that makes sense that feels right in here tell me more kettlebellswinging guy  what other advice do you have for all areas of my life including my relationships and financial investments please give me guidance kettlebellswinging guy so what do you do you watch his next video on autoplay then you watch his next video here comes the youtube algorithm with a suggested video and here comes another suggested video and a week later jordan peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men  five weeks later youre storming the capitol dressed  a buffalo    thats a very realistic sequence of events by the way thats not even an exaggerated timeline every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm we all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that mens selfhelp andrew tate masculinity youtube selfhelp algorithm if you dont know anyone who lost their mind  youre the one who lost their mind youre currently in an echo chamber of assholes cause real friends tell you when youre losing your mind its very tragic all these men who are trying to be better people and theyre seeking guidance but that youtube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves theres tragedy in that  all those people they were just trying to lift weights  they werent trying to cause an insurrection they didnt even know what that word meant they were just trying to do this theyre trying to do this they didnt know what angle their forearm was supposed to be visàvis their torso right is it  degrees or  degrees  is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you they googled it one time and then five weeks later youre taking a shit on nancy pelosis desk  and the us marshals are garnishing your wages because you take one wrong turn and life moves pretty quick im not saying as a man dont take responsibility for your own actions  im just saying that youtube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys it it sucks men in in a way that i dont think women understand it really preys on that mens need to seek guidance from somewhere its very hard to resist it just draws draws you in thats why fucking mark zuckerberg is trying to mma fight elon musk right now  that guy fell for his own algorithm do you unders',\n",
              "  'tand mark zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd and for   years now hes just been looking at our data right jerking off every single day just looking at our data jerking off money piling up billions of dollars data jerking off money money jerking off data for  years that loop and who knew after two decades of that one day he just looked at so much data he was  oh shit oh shit he fell into it now hes trying to mmafight elon musk that guy jerked off and came on his own face   its out of control zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality and he invented that shit and he still fell for it what hope does the average man in america have just walking just waddling down the street looking looking for a taco on his phone hes gonna get sucked into his phone he has no chance that fucking guy has no chance because even the good guys in this room were all  on a razors edge to being a piece of shit   that margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razorthin i gotta tell you if you have the means every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge and  what an instagram post could push it either way   it depends on the post was it cute animals or was it boobs  thats gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours i do think as a society we need to  do a better job of identifying  when we have a disagreement with someone whos genuinely trying to have a goodfaith discussion to reach higher understanding and whos just talking shit we are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit and were not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics  for example me right now im just talking shit   this is oneway shittalking i dont care about any of your opinions do not send me any of them i do not care you paid for me i didnt pay a cent for any of you    free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shittalking session if you dont  it take it out on adam smith but if i was having a conversation with someone i disagree with in good faith i would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with thatd be a logical place to start a difficult conversation for example maga make america great again they have a point americas not doing so great right now right our kids math scores are down  our childrens science scores are down when judged according to international metrics  healthcare systems not doing so great wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially there was an implied promise to a generation of americans that if you do certain things work hard go to college be a good person you would have certain outcomes and those outcomes didnt materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decisionmaking positions lowered the capital gains tax  so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year in postworld war ii us leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for national security by making the us dollar the default international trade currency which gave america the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a us financial banking system but consequently increased the value of the us dollar astronomically which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in america  although the logic at the time  was that americans were supposed to upskill en masse away from the menial manufacturing jobs but everyone heres too much of a dumbass to stay school so we just traded domestic manufacturing to asia and the rest of the world at the expense of workingclass families but if you dont read enough  it comes out as lets go brandon  and its  you have a point but you dont have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didnt read enough you gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag theres a book behind the word you gotta keep going you can go at your own pace but you gotta finish the required reading otherwise we cant have a conversation were all catching up to each other im friends with maga im friends with the magas some of them are my good friends  whoo yeah hawaii

wanna die for your country but were losing the engineering jobs to asia right now so if you we need less people to die for their country we need more people to do their homework for their country  do

you will fucking top the school im telling you its skys the limit  dude youll youll solve a lot of problems youll create a lot of jobs youll increase the gdp just do do your homework for your country

friends and i out of mutual respect inevitably it comes up some stuff im wrong about some stuff theyre right about but sometimes  their messaging is so convoluted  i cant get to what their core issue

gullible because these baby boomers they dont have the they dont have the antibodies to deal with the internet completely clueless when they go on now  watching baby boomers go on the internet now is

              "  'is has there ever been a dumber generation of idiots more susceptible to fake news than these fucking baby boomers literally believing everything they see on the internet i get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last due to the exponential technology growth curve  but this has got to be the biggest gap in human history the information asymmetry right now is just out of control you literally have people in honolulu right now autodriving their tesla cybertrucks as they vape out the window and their phone ai is trading cryptocurrency meanwhile you have baby boomers they cant even rightclick  they cant even rightclick theres one button how do you rightclick on one button its scary they dont know whats real anymore hey ronny look at this photo of bigfoot shopping at whole foods  bigfoot is real now look theres an image of him buying kombucha at whole foods what technology exists that can fake images im  mom thats not real stop sending it around its not real how do  they always get so indignant about it  how do  that its not real how did  that because the font the font is off and the resolution of the image is blurry and that lighting state doesnt make sense for that image and thats not standard dimensions for a news article i cant give you this knowledge its  malcolm gladwells blink ive seen so much shit on the internet my brain instantly filters it youll never have this skill set so just stay off the internet this world is not for you anymore stop making decisions  but anyway respect your elders  its a confucian value maybe if you give your mom some money she wouldnt get scammed so much yeah well think about the correlation between those two phenomena  people always ask me  why do you shit on your mom for money why dont you shit on your dad for money    no i dont talk about my dad because  my dad has no context for show business  we grew up in malaysia  his families are rubber tappers in malaysia my aunts and uncles are still in sitiawan in malaysia right now tapping rubber they have no context for show business very smart people but they dont know this world my dad he was the first guy in his family to get a college education he went to manchester college which has merged with the university of southern new hampshire he got his masters of economics there put himself through it very smart guy and he was a good immigrant he came to america to new hampshire to get his education and when he graduated he went back to malaysia he didnt take anyones job he left  and my dad had the vision to see what i didnt see he knew he had a ceiling on him because of the way he thinks and talks and he went back to malaysia and he was right for him he went back it was the right choice for him he became a very successful corporate executive  he retired to a farm in johor bahru malaysia love farming he retired to a farm thats how much this guy loved it but he had no context for show business so he wouldnt understand anything im doing  he wouldnt understand what im doing in godzilla vs kong hed be  why dont you just run that way  dad i dont control the edit  im just honolulu chinatown shopkeeper no  in this in this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla  im just connecting act  to act  i dont have a say in how this plays out because of that i stopped telling him about what i was doing i felt he wouldnt get it and he stopped asking me so i didnt tell him i got hired on the daily show he found out the way all parents find out about their kids accolades through a local newspaper so one day the local paper reported that i got hired on the daily show and he called me immediately he was  ronny whats this i hear about you joining the everyday show and i was  oh no its the daily show i joined  two years ago dad he was  oh  well whats the daily show im  its just  another latenight american talk show they kind of invented modern american satire and  and  my dad was  oh thats cool are you the host im  no im a correspondent he was  what is that whats a correspondent im  yeah correspondent is i help the host with comedy segments and he was  oh  hey mei hes just a sidekick  and so he had  no context for what was a win what was a milestone in this industry and so i stopped telling him and he stopped asking me and i didnt need that from him we we were totally fine wed talk about other stuff not about work we werent fighting it was all good  and he passed away very suddenly  in  he died on christmas eve died on his farm  no warning no explanation he just left one day he left so suddenly we had to go back to handle his estate if anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position when you have to handle someone elses estate it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life and so its me my wife my sister brotherinlaw went back to johor bahru and part of me trying to figure out his estate was i had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using so his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it and i opened it up and its passwordprotected and i know this guy so well im  his password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child so  i type in my sisters birthday and spot on spot on it was my sisters birthday  as it should be shes  an anesthesiologist in australia shes  way more respectable person than me actually saving lives  a good person contributing back to society not  this fucking asshole i get in  i get in trouble on the internet for shit i said two years ago every six weeks so it should be her she should be the favorite so i log into his computer i open his web browser i look at his browsing history and the whole time im  please dont let me find my dads porn please dont let me find what positions my dad was into even if it was just missionary i wouldnt be able to handle it im gonna have to burn this laptop for real chinese people when we burn things it goes to our ancestors and then my granddad is gonna see it and its  i dont i dont want that for them ill be fine but theyre gonna have an awkward time im considerate  that  so i open the web browser look at his history and way to go dad no porn what a cleancut guy no porn he only went on the internet twice a day  clockwork  am and  pm  the farmer that he was and every time he went on the internet hed only go to two websites each time so the first website hed go to was a local news website and the second website hed go to twice a day every single day was my twitter page  aw so hed be reloading my twitter page twice a day just to see what i was doing and i post stuff  hey honolulu hawaii i sold out five shows  this week whys there so many homeless people here id post stuff  that  and  he would read that and then hed be  i assume hed be  oh ronnys doing  hes in hawaii he sold out some shows and oh i guess theres a lot of homeless people in hawaii  and  that was his quiet way of keeping up with me he never told me that and i never knew that and we never discussed it  which is a very nice sentiment unfortunately  as best as i can tell this is the last tweet my dad read of mine  so as best as i can tell forensically based on internet browsing timestamps the last tweet my dad read of mine and quite possibly the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm was me posting on twitter if youre a baby boomer on twitter i already know youre a fucking loser  now obviously this was not directed towards him i didnt even know he had twitter i didnt even know he knew what twitter was but i stand by the statement   and i know thats kind of a weird way to end the show but    if its any solace  this was his phone when he died  aw that was his  wallpaper and his screensaver and  and i didnt even know and its a photo of me and my wife and were in hawaii and im wearing two leis cause my mom threw one off and i put it on  and  i didnt know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper  and   i i  to i  to think that  that is the last image he saw of me thats what he
