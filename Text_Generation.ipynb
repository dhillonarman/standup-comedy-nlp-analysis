Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, \\u2019cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very exciting day for me. It\\u2019s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought\\u2026 is \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cFuck you. I don\\u2019t even know you, but fuck you!\\u201d \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m straight up jealous. I\\u2019m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. And then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don\\u2019t have insomnia yet. They don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don\\u2019t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It\\u2019s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don\\u2019t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It\\u2019s coming. You don\\u2019t have HPV yet, you\\u2019re a fucking loser, all right? That\\u2019s what that says about you. A lot of men don\\u2019t know that they have HPV, because it\\u2019s undetectable in men. It\\u2019s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says, \\u201cBoo!\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We\\u2019ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I\\u2019m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I\\u2019m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that\\u2019s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That\\u2019s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I\\u2019m a horrible person, I\\u2019m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82\\u2026 manual. The manual. She don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, \\u201cYou never know when you might need this.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cBut\\u2026 I do know\\u2026 that I\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.\\u201d I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I\\u2019m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They\\u2019re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me, he\\u2019s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, who is that?\\u201d And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m gonna trap his ass.\\u201d \\u201cGoing to trap his ass!\\u201d And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, \\u201cAll right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.\\u201d When, really, it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to\\u2026 It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had\\u2026 We had so much chemistry. He was like, \\u201cHey, wassup?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWassup?\\u201d And we\\u2013 The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, \\u201cHey, can you drop me off?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He was like, \\u201cAt the park.\\u201d And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, \\u201cOh, no!\\u201d \\u201cI just fucked a homeless dude! Again!\\u201d My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It\\u2019s\\u2026 too much. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 You feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you\\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very, you know, it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know, just right there, through the money hole and just\\u2026 And then also, he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there. I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cI could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!\\u201d You know? But I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don\\u2019t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing. It\\u2019s what love is built on, you know? My last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, \\u201cHold it. You guys aren\\u2019t Mexican?\\u201d Asian-American men are very underrated. I don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them. They\\u2019re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It\\u2019s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI did not ask to be exfoliated today.\\u201d \\u201cThis is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.\\u201d And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from. I think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he\\u2019s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we\\u2019re both half-fancy Asian\\u2026 \\u2026and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn\\u2019t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!\\u201d I was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not authentic, OK?\\u201d You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That\\u2019s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it\\u2019s funny, right, because he\\u2019s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I\\u2013 I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition. That\\u2019s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head. First passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, \\u201cShut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?\\u201d And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, \\u201cOh, my God! He proposed!\\u201d \\u201cIt came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something\\u2026 that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.\\u201d Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday\\u2026 because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That\\u2019s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I\\u2019m a completely different person. You\\u2013 Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I\\u2019m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We\\u2019ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me. \\u2018Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t. I straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she\\u2019s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don\\u2019t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re dumb women. We don\\u2019t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018Cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility.\\u201d And then, all these women had to show off and be like, \\u201cWe could do it! We could do anything.\\u201d \\u201cBitch, shut up!\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell them the secret.\\u201d They ruined it for us, and now we\\u2019re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, \\u201cDouble-income household,\\u201d I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cBut, Ali, we have so many more options now.\\u201d Oh, you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? A lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street. And they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cLook at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat bitch is a genius.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a housewife, she\\u2019s retired.\\u201d I do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day, every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don\\u2019t gotta do that. They don\\u2019t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your co-worker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, no! Courtney\\u2019s listening. She\\u2019s waiting. She\\u2019s timing me.\\u201d And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don\\u2019t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don\\u2019t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want. You know, it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, \\u201cYou need to get to work on time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYou need to eat bananas.\\u201d \\u201cI saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.\\u201d My father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, \\u201cHey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhy you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don\\u2019t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, \\u2018I do,\\u2019 what I really meant was, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m done.'\\u201d I\\u2019m done. I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore and I\\u2019m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I\\u2019ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That\\u2019s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just\\u2026 Let\\u2019s redecorate. I gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I\\u2019m a\\u2013 I\\u2019m a disgusting pervert. I\\u2019m a pervert. I\\u2019m a gross filthy animal. And I think it\\u2019s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\\u2026 y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it\\u2019s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you. I broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, \\u201cUh, you\\u2019re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist\\u2026 and posted \\u2018Tiny Asian female seeking anal\\u2026\\u2019 the Internet would crash.\\u201d \\u201cAnd all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.\\u201d They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know\\u2026 freaked out about anal. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t wanna do that. I\\u2019m scared of\\u2013 of the pain.\\u201d You ain\\u2019t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You\\u2019re not scared of the pain. What you\\u2019re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You\\u2019re scared that he\\u2019s gonna see that and that\\u2019s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can\\u2019t help you now. But don\\u2019t worry, \\u2019cause when he puts it in the butt, all he\\u2019s thinking about is, \\u201cI just put it in her butt.\\u201d \\u201cI gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.\\u201d You\\u2019re\\u2013 If you\\u2019re married, you\\u2019re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don\\u2019t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you\\u2019ll feel like you\\u2019re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I\\u2019m a little bit\\u2026 \\u2026stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, \\u201cOh, my God! It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m going back in time!\\u201d \\u266a A whole new world \\u266a It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to\\u2026 Now, if you haven\\u2019t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your\\u2013 Just give your man a little\\u2013 a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you\\u2019ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You\\u2019ll get a lot of \\u201cNo! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 No! I don\\u2019t! I don\\u2019t! No!\\u201d They get all squirmy wormy because\\u2026 they\\u2019re scared. They\\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they\\u2019re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man\\u2019s eye like he\\u2019s discovered nirvana. And it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When\\u2013 When I\\u2019ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. \\u201cHey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?\\u201d I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cYes, I know you respect me and that\\u2019s why you need to abuse me. OK?\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their\\u2013 Glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 It\\u2019s because we\\u2019re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t wanna die! Don\\u2019t kill me! I don\\u2019t wanna die!\\u201d But I also don\\u2019t want to be sure that I\\u2019m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just\\u2013 Just choke me enough so that I can\\u2019t talk. \\u2018Cause if I can talk, I\\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. And I\\u2019m tired of being the boss. I\\u2019m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I\\u2019m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools, because according to her, it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy,\\u201d because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re bossy,\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say, \\u201cYou have executive leadership skills.\\u201d Which is a very roundabout way of saying: \\u201cYou\\u2019re a little cunt.\\u201d I\\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I\\u2019m talking about? I\\u2019m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That\\u2019s the kind of income bracket I\\u2019m striving for. That\\u2019s when you know you\\u2019ve made it, when you\\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango\\u2026 \\u2026Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don\\u2019t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It\\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics\\u2026 don\\u2019t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There\\u2019s\\u2013 None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That\\u2019s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cGuys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit. It\\u2019s so annoying and boring.\\u201d And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s hilarious. I identify.\\u201d And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper \\u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\\u2019s head shredding it up. She\\u2019s busy. So, I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, \\u201cAli, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become\\u2013 You\\u2019re gonna disappear, and you\\u2019re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s the dream.\\u201d That\\u2019s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know? Another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, \\u201cWhy are you gonna have a kid? Why don\\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s cool\\u2026 until my husband dies.\\u201d Which he\\u2019s definitely gonna before me. Because I\\u2019m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I\\u2019m a billion. I\\u2019m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack.\\u201d Well, Asian don\\u2019t die. We don\\u2019t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers? Because we\\u2019re trying to die. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!\\u201d \\u201cImma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna make a right turn\\u2013 I changed my mind, it\\u2019s a U-turn!\\u201d \\u201cI changed my mind again. It\\u2019s a O-turn!\\u201d Every time I get into a car accident\\u2026 \\u2026I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, my God, not again!\\u201d I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me, but I\\u2019m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It\\u2019s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. \\u2018Cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I\\u2019m just kidding. She doesn\\u2019t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I\\u2019m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore. I\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That\\u2019s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don\\u2019t give a fuck. They got no shame. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park, do this shit.\\u201d They do that \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a free activity. For them. They do it in their\\u2013 their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh, I\\u2019m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it\\u2013 And it scared me. Like, I\\u2019m only 33 and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It\\u2019s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just\\u2026 \\u201cI slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what kind of mother I\\u2019m gonna be. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. \\u201cUh, mmm.\\u201d They watch Property Brothers, scratch, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019? Mmm.\\u201d Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, \\u201cWhen can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers?\\u201d Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood. If it\\u2019s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, \\u201cOh, my God, that\\u2019s so hot. You guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019?\\u201d No, dude. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in\\u2013 When you\\u2019re in your 30s, and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019. It tells you when it\\u2019s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Release the Kraken!'\\u201d And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um\\u2026 yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex, \\u2019cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOK, it\\u2019s go time,\\u201d and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says, \\u201cPlease, hurry the fuck up.\\u201d And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupid-ass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just\\u2026 And then, because we\\u2019re hippies, I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cHey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?\\u201d And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That\\u2019s right. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, my God. That\\u2019s so dark and terrible. I can\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d I\\u2019m 33. Girl, when you\\u2019re 33, you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It\\u2019s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom\\u2013 She\\u2019s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, \\u201cUh, yeah. Where I\\u2019m from, that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes. It\\u2019s whatevs, OK?\\u201d And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, \\u201cOh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you\\u2019re having twins.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo!\\u201d And then she said, \\u201cBut what I don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d \\u201cThe Lord is mysterious!\\u201d Don\\u2019t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, \\u201cYou look.\\u201d \\u201cYou watch the whole thing.\\u201d And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyonc\\u00e9. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That\\u2019s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth, though. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m very, very scared of childbirth. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser S\\u00f6ze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, \\u201cAli, did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\\u201d I\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can\\u2019t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That\\u2019s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. \\u201cHey, can you wash the dishes?\\u201d \\u201cNo!\\u201d \\u201cCan you water the plants?\\u201d \\u201cI am not doing jack shit anymore. I\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball, OK? Are you makin\\u2019 a foot? I didn\\u2019t think so. You change the channel.\\u201d I can already see how there\\u2019s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me. \\u201cOh, my God. I can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments. He is so supportive.\\u201d Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I\\u2019m the star of the show. There\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if I\\u2019m not there. But he\\u2019s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I\\u2019m a bad mommy. You know, I\\u2013 I\\u2013 I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I\\u2019m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn\\u2019t know that. I didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big\\u2013 they get big, like fingers. Like, \\u201cYou, you. You owe me money, you.\\u201d My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy\\u2019s all wet again. But it\\u2019s different. It\\u2019s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, \\u201cWhy is it different?\\u201d And I looked it up, and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That\\u2019s not the same. When it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue, when it\\u2019s Neosporin. So, you know, I\\u2013 I, in\\u2013 previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who\\u2019s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he\\u2019s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron\\u2019d my ass. And now, if I don\\u2019t work, we die. Why else do you think I\\u2019m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I\\u2019ve been Ali Wong.

Thank you, San Francisco. Thank you so much. So good to be here. People were surprised when I told \\u2019em I was gonna tape my special in San Francisco. Said, \\u201cWhy would you do that? That\\u2019s the most politically correct city in the world.\\u201d Not when I\\u2019m on stage, it\\u2019s not. I love this place. One of my favorite cities to perform in. It\\u2019s a good place to hang out. Got to walk around a little bit today. Saw a baby. Saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. So it\\u2019s been a great day. Love that. Don\\u2019t get me wrong. I\\u2019m not a monster. I tried to help the baby. Tried to throw a rock through the window. Window was down. Ruined that baby\\u2019s whole weekend. It was worth it. I love San Francisco. One of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. Yeah. Women in San Francisco are gorgeous. I say that despite what\\u2019s\\u2026 going on in this crowd tonight. But you guys live here. You guys live here. You\\u2019ve seen \\u2019em. I was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. Like a supermodel. I walked up, I was like, \\u201cHey, where you from? What do you do?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cOh, me? I live here in San Francisco. I\\u2019m a brain surgeon.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if this makes me sexist, but I was really impressed. You know? I mean\\u2026 Most women\\u2026 can\\u2019t pull off sarcasm. This is gonna be a good show. See, that joke, that joke is a test. To see if you guys are cool or not. That thing about the baby in the car, that\\u2019s just me clearing my throat. That joke\\u2019s the test. If you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. You don\\u2019t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. And I\\u2019ve had shows go very, very bad. Doesn\\u2019t matter to me at all. Now, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. I, uh\\u2026 I used to have a son. Already some of you see where this is going, that\\u2019s good. That\\u2019s good. I used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. The same way Eric Clapton\\u2019s son died. For inspiration. I\\u2019m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. You guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. Then started clapping, that is amazing. Most people just boo me. But if you didn\\u2019t understand the joke\\u2026 don\\u2019t worry. It\\u2019s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. That joke is like an onion. You\\u2019ve gotta know who Eric Clapton is. Not a given these days. You\\u2019ve gotta know about his kid. You gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. You gotta know about that terrible fucking song. And then you gotta think all that\\u2019s funny. Now, I gotta get to know you guys a little bit. Starting with you for sure. I can tell you\\u2019re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. Did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? What is your name? \\u2013 Peggy Jo. \\u2013 Peggy. Peggy, what do you try to do? Not a lot, I\\u2019m disabled. You\\u2019re disabled? I know you\\u2019re disabled. Is this your husband with you? Okay. Sir, what do you do, so I can move the fuck on. \\u2013 I\\u2019m an electrician. \\u2013 You\\u2019re an electrician? Great. That\\u2019s an honorable job. That\\u2019s a good job to have. I\\u2019m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. Electrician. It\\u2019s a wonderful job. There\\u2019s a lot of bad jobs out there, I\\u2019ll tell you that right now. Lot of bad jobs. Hell, my Uncle John runs a summer camp for\\u2026 kids about to get molested. I know, right? I know, it sounds awful. Sounds awful, but he loves it. He\\u2019s like\\u2026 Says he\\u2019s never worked a day in his life. Doesn\\u2019t pay much, but the benefits\\u2026 Do you guys have any kids? How many? I have one, and he has two. Okay. You guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offenders live around you? Isn\\u2019t it crazy? Isn\\u2019t it way more than you\\u2019d think? You think it might be like one or two. No, it\\u2019s like chicken pox. I went online, 15 child molesters. Fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. So, why do we always have to meet at my place? And if you\\u2019re wondering, \\u201cAnthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know, probably. Seems like something I would do. I of course live in Los Angeles. I\\u2019ve got a nice place. Obviously. My brother\\u2019s been staying with me, which has been awful. My brother is crazy. Even my neighbors hate him. The other day I opened the door, I caught him masturbating. He looks me right in the eyes and goes, \\u201cShut the door.\\u201d I said, \\u201cGet inside.\\u201d My family loves it when I put them in jokes. They love it. \\u201cAnthony, please, put me in your next joke.\\u201d \\u201cAre you sure? I\\u2019m gonna make you a pedophile.\\u201d \\u201cWe don\\u2019t care. We wanna be part of this thing you\\u2019ve got going on.\\u201d So I wrote that joke, put my brother in. I\\u2019m in Chicago, where he lives. After the show, he comes backstage and I say, \\u201cMikey, what\\u2019d you think about that new joke? Did you like the shout out?\\u201d And he gets all uncomfortable. He goes, \\u201cWell, crowd seemed to think it was funny\\u2026 but I think it\\u2019s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cWhat, Mikey? No! No, Mikey. You\\u2019re my brother. That\\u2019s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cYeah, and then you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Get back inside.'\\u201d Just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother\\u2019s a fuckin\\u2019 idiot. Yeah, I\\u2019ve got a nice place. Try to keep it nice. Not always successful. Like, I tried getting a puppy. Disaster. Had to get rid of that puppy. Had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. The first time I left it home alone, the first time I left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. Why are you mad? I\\u2019m the one who couldn\\u2019t get his money back. And this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. After I kill a puppy with neglect. And it\\u2019s okay. It\\u2019s okay, you can get mad at me. You can hate me. You can hate me and still laugh at me. That\\u2019s how talented I am. And I\\u2019m used to it. I\\u2019m used to it. I once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. Once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. I didn\\u2019t do anything about it. I didn\\u2019t say anything about it. I just turned around and left the room. But in my head, in my head, all I was thinking was\\u2026 \\u201cNow we\\u2019re even.\\u201d She was so mad. She got mad at me. She got mad at me \\u2019cause I killed all of her plants. Killed every single one of her house plants. And she had told me. She said, \\u201cAnthony, I\\u2019m going out of town for two weeks. Give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.\\u201d But I\\u2019m a dude. All I heard was \\u201ctwo weeks\\u201d and \\u201ccheat on me.\\u201d Like my neighbors in L.A\\u2026 My neighbors in L.A. have got this smokin\\u2019 hot 18-year-old daughter. I mean, she\\u2019s perfect. But she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. Which is horrible. Doesn\\u2019t she understand how dumb that\\u2019s gonna look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? Yeah, that\\u2019s a joke. That\\u2019s a joke where I\\u2019m a serial killer. I\\u2019m very open about it. Don\\u2019t you dare tighten up on me. I hate sensitivity. I hate it. Even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. I got a six-year-old nephew. I asked what he wants for his birthday. He said, \\u201cUncle Anthony, I want you to get me a Barbie doll.\\u201d I said, \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cYou six-year-old piece of shit.\\u201d And don\\u2019t get me wrong. Don\\u2019t get me wrong, I don\\u2019t care if he plays with dolls. He can wear dresses if he wants to. But I\\u2019m not getting him a Barbie doll. You see, Barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations\\u2026 \\u2026of how easy it\\u2019s gonna be to tear off a head. I won\\u2019t do it. I get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. If you\\u2019re sensitive about comedy, it\\u2019s the dumbest thing you can do. I call them the joke police. They always have one rule, one rule they have. You can\\u2019t make fun of this right now. After a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it\\u2019s so hypocritical. Like the thing today, the thing right now you can\\u2019t make fun of, the thing that\\u2019s too sensitive at this moment? Trans-gendered people. See? You can\\u2019t do it. Can\\u2019t make fun of them. It\\u2019s too sensitive. In fact, you can\\u2019t even call them \\u201cchicks with dicks\\u201d anymore. No. No. You have to call them \\u201cmen who talk too much.\\u201d Right? But I hear this all the time. People\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cAnthony, that was really funny. But, man, women must hate you. Women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.\\u201d And I always say, \\u201cNo. No. Stupid women hate my shows.\\u201d \\u201cStupid women hate my shows. Smart women\\u2026 don\\u2019t come to my shows.\\u201d Speaking of which, what\\u2019s your name? \\u2013 What? Kim. \\u2013 Kim. \\u2013 Kim, where you from? \\u2013 San Jose. San Jose? Okay. What do you do, Kim? Um, I\\u2019m a branch manager. \\u2013 Like for a bank? For a Pizza Hut? \\u2013 No, for\\u2026 What? What the fuck? Where\\u2019d you go to school? \\u2013 UC Santa Cruz. \\u2013 What\\u2019d you study? \\u2013 Economics. \\u2013 Economics? Okay. You ever gonna use that someday? I had to go to Catholic school when I was a kid. Hated Catholic school. Hated Catholic school more than anything. The nuns were vicious. They would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. Anything to defend themselves. You guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? Hated school. When I was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. Came down with the cancer. Which was sad. But the story is actually cool and inspiring. Every single guy\\u2026 Every single guy in the school, we all\\u2026 shaved our heads to make fun of him. Yeah. No, it was great. It was great, we did it for like a month. We would have kept doin\\u2019 it, but you know. You know how cancer gets. You guys ever\\u2026 You guys ever trace back your family history? Go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn\\u2019t know? I traced my family tree back, found that I actually had family fighting on both sides in World War II. Humiliating. The piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the Nazi infantry in Germany, while the bad-ass Jeselniks were here in America spying for the Germans. I assume everyone is drinking tonight? \\u2013 Yeah! \\u2013 Yeah! Whoo! That\\u2019s good. I love to drink. Love it. Do it all the time, every day, always have. I don\\u2019t know where it comes from either. Even my parents tell me, when I was just a little baby, I used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet\\u2026 to try to spend time with them. I like San Francisco, so liberal. So liberal. Clap your hands here. Clap your hands if you own a gun. San Jose is in the house, huh? Not too bad. I once asked the crowd in Houston that question. They just started firing guns in the air. Didn\\u2019t even let me finish the question. I don\\u2019t own a gun. I\\u2019m against guns, to be honest. When I was a kid\\u2026 When I was a kid, my parents had a gun. My parents said we had to have a gun. Gotta have a gun to protect the five children. Gotta have a gun to protect our five children. Of course, they eventually got rid of it\\u2026 to protect their four children. I\\u2019m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. I was getting pretty good towards the end. Man, my parents were strict. Mom and dad were strict. My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. I learned a lot from my parents. Especially my dad. Like, I\\u2019ll never forget\\u2026 the first time I ever got a bad report card in school. First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. Beat the hell out of me. But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom. Let her take the hit. Yeah.\\nMy dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don\\u2019t take classes. You don\\u2019t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out. Like, when I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR.\\nAs a kid, my dad\\u2019s prized possession, my dad\\u2019s favorite thing in the world growing up? My dad was the proud owner of a Mickey Mantle rookie card. Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. Kept it between two little pieces of plastic. But I was a kid. I didn\\u2019t know any better. One day I took that card to school and I traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. You know what that card is worth today? My relationship with my father.\\nI mean it, my dad was no joke. My dad did not fuck around. My dad did not trust anybody. My dad did not trust anyone. In fact, he had a saying\\u2026 but he wouldn\\u2019t tell me. What, too clever for you? That joke is fuckin\\u2019 amazing. Last year was a sad year for my family. Last year, my mom should\\u2019ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. But because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. It was sad.\\nWhen I was a kid, I used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. When I was a kid, we were poor. So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. Of course this was before 9/11 so\\u2026 my bad, everybody. Weird joke to clap for, but sure. My mom actually should\\u2019ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.\\nI mean, don\\u2019t get me wrong, I loved my mother. She was my mom, of course I loved her. We fought a lot. My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That\\u2019s ignorance and I hate that. When I was a kid, like nine years old, I\\u2019d come home after school. Once in a while, I\\u2019d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. Once in a while, I\\u2019d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She\\u2019d pull me aside and say, \\u201cAnthony, who\\u2019s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?\\u201d And I would say, \\u201cShut up, Mom, that\\u2019s racist. Put your money away.\\u201d I never get to see my family anymore, really. Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. \\u2018Cause they\\u2019re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony. You. \\u2013 What\\u2019s your name? \\u2013 Melissa. \\u2013 Melissa, where you from? \\u2013 Santa Clara. \\u2013 What do you do? \\u2013 I win things on the radio. \\u2013 You win things on the radio? \\u2013 Yeah. Follow-up question, how\\u2019d you get tickets to this? Let me ask you this. You ever, uh\\u2026 you ever find a body in the woods? Ever do that? No? It\\u2019s okay. I have. I was walking through the woods one day and\\u2026 some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something. I never told anybody about it. But I went back there a week later, and he was dead. Yeah. I do crazy shit like that all the time. What can I say? I\\u2019m wacky. The other night I was driving my car. I was driving my car and I ran over a deer\\u2026 a dear, dear friend. I\\u2019m torn constantly. At night, I do shows, but during the day, I\\u2019ve got a hobby. During the day, I go from town to town\\u2026 and I shut down the local abortion clinic. You heard me. I shut down abortion clinics everywhere I go. It\\u2019s easy for me. I\\u2019m charming. I stand outside the front doors all day long and\\u2026 consistently underbid them. You guys mad about that one? It\\u2019s gonna get so much fuckin\\u2019 worse. Gotta talk to one more person. You, sir. What\\u2019s your name? \\u2013 Allan. \\u2013 Allan, where you from? \\u2013 Frisco. \\u2013 Frisco. I can tell you\\u2019re a local \\u2019cause of how cool you are. What do you do, Frisco? \\u2013 I fight fires. I fight fires. \\u2013 You what? You\\u2019re a firefighter? Awesome. What do you wanna do? If you could do anything. If you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? \\u2013 Travel the world. \\u2013 Travel the world. It\\u2019s good to have a dream. I hope you go for it. It doesn\\u2019t sound like you\\u2019re even gonna get close. I think you should do it. Travel the world. Do it.\\nEveryone should try to live their dream, that\\u2019s my point. Everyone. I get to live my dream. I mean, not when I\\u2019m in San Francisco, but for the most part. Being a comedian was my dream. \\u2018Cause no one can tell me what to do. That\\u2019s all I cared about. Most people don\\u2019t ever try to live their dream. Lot of people try and they fail. Which I think is better, more noble, more respectable.\\nI had an uncle. All he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about\\u2026 wanted to become an astronaut. Fly into space one day. And he went for it. He went for it. And he failed. He blew it. Ended up becoming one of those pussies\\u2026 \\u2026on the Space Shuttle Challenger. You guys remember that, right? I think it\\u2019s funny. I think it\\u2019s funny how the things that happen to us when we\\u2019re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. I got this little niece. When she was three years old, she almost drowned. And now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. Yeah, I was babysitting her\\u2026 and trying to do laundry. And she accidentally fell into the washing machine. Thought I was quick. I got good reflexes. I thought I got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. Turned everything pink. You\\u2019re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. Hey, did you guys know\\u2026 Did you guys know that when a newborn baby\\u2026 when a newborn baby is first born, when it\\u2019s fresh out of the womb\\u2026 it can actually hear and see everything around it\\u2026 for up to ten seconds after it\\u2019s decapitated? Yeah. Yeah. I never know what to say. I never know what to say to someone after they\\u2019ve lost a baby. What do you say to someone after they\\u2019ve lost a baby? \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m sorry for your loss\\u201d? Doesn\\u2019t cut it. \\u201cAre you gonna be okay?\\u201d Not even close. That\\u2019s why I just keep my mouth shut. Let my lawyer do the talking. I\\u2019m not good with kids. That\\u2019s my point. That\\u2019s what this whole thing\\u2019s about. I\\u2019m not good with kids. Not gonna lie. Hell, a couple of months ago, I dropped my cousin\\u2019s baby. Flat-out dropped my cousin\\u2019s baby on the ground. But I don\\u2019t feel like that was my fault. I don\\u2019t feel responsible for that one, you know? Who in their right mind\\u2026 who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me, Anthony Jeselnik, to be a pallbearer? It\\u2019s okay, people hate\\u2026 people hate dead baby jokes. They hate them. They hate them. It\\u2019s like, \\u201cAnthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? Why do you have so many dead baby jokes?\\u201d \\u201cNo one likes them, why do you insist?\\u201d Well, I\\u2019ll tell you why. Because dead baby jokes have made me rich. And who was it? Who was it who said the first million is the hardest? Was it Hitler? Didn\\u2019t see that one coming, did you? That was a good response. Most audiences just pretend I didn\\u2019t say it. But I like it. I like making Hitler jokes. It\\u2019s cool for me. I enjoy it. Hell, I lost my grandfather. I lost my grandfather in the Holocaust Museum. It was the Holocaust Museum of Modern Art. Which is just like a normal Holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, \\u201cOh! I should have thought of that.\\u201d My grandmother died about a year ago. And I didn\\u2019t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. But I was wrong. It was fine. The hard part, the upsetting part\\u2026 was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. She wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh\\u2026 You, radio winner. What\\u2019s the best way you can die? This is not a trick question. \\u2013 In your sleep? \\u2013 Yes, thank you. Thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. Not me. I want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. But my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. We thought that\\u2019s how she went. We were all excited for her. But then we did an autopsy. Found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. During an autopsy. It was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. She always said her grandkids didn\\u2019t pay enough attention to her and\\u2026 and she was right. She was dead on. But I loved my grandma. Loved her very much. My grandma taught me about a lot. Taught me what religion is. Taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. I\\u2019ll tell you now. When I graduated from high school\\u2026 When I graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, \\u201cAnthony, I\\u2019m so proud of you. You\\u2019re my first grandchild to get to go to college. What can I do for you, what can I give you before you go to college?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cHonestly, Grandma, all I need from you is money.\\u201d Yeah, I know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. And my grandma said, \\u201cOkay, Anthony, I understand.\\u201d Couple months go by. It\\u2019s the end of summer. I\\u2019m packing up my dad\\u2019s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. Says, \\u201cAnthony, here, before you leave, take this.\\u201d And she handed me a brand-new Bible. King James Version. And I said, \\u201cThanks, Grandma, that\\u2019s exactly what we talked about.\\u201d I got in the car and I went off to school. Couple of weeks go by, I\\u2019m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. It\\u2019s my grandma. \\u201cAnthony, just calling to see how college is going.\\u201d \\u201cGrandma, college is the best. I\\u2019m having the time of my life. But to be honest, I\\u2019m starting to run low on money, and I could use a little bit, like we talked about.\\u201d She said, \\u201cOkay, well let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cTotally, Grandma, I\\u2019m on chapter four.\\u201d She said, \\u201cOkay, Anthony, I guess I\\u2019ll talk to you later.\\u201d Hung up the phone. Couple of months go by. Now I\\u2019m really starting to struggle financially. Might have to drop out of school, so I call my grandma in a panic. I say, \\u201cPlease, it\\u2019s Anthony. I\\u2019m having the time of my life in college. But if I wanna graduate, and I do, I need you to send me some money like we talked about.\\u201d She said, \\u201cAnthony, let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYes, Grandma! I wish it was longer!\\u201d And she said, \\u201cOkay, Anthony. I guess I\\u2019ll talk to you later.\\u201d Finally, it\\u2019s the end of the school year. I\\u2019ve got straight A\\u2019s, but I\\u2019m dropping out of college, \\u2019cause I have no more money left. And I\\u2019m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. It\\u2019s my grandma. \\u201cAnthony, I heard you\\u2019re dropping out of school today. How come?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou know goddamn well how come, Grandma! \\u2018Cause you wouldn\\u2019t give me any money.\\u201d She said, \\u201cAnthony, let me ask you this: Did you read your Bible?\\u201d And I just hung up the phone. I was so pissed off. Took everything out of that room. Last thing I took off the shelf, the last thing I took out of that room, was that Bible my grandma had given me. Took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, I actually opened it up. And on the very first page, in my grandmother\\u2019s handwriting, it said, \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d Thank you everyone. I hope you enjoyed the jokes I prepared for you tonight. And all the jokes I write, they\\u2019re all made up, they\\u2019re all fake, except for Eric Clapton and the Challenger. Everything else\\u2026 everything else is fake. But everything I\\u2019m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that\\u2019s all true. Now\\u2026 I don\\u2019t tell dark jokes because I\\u2019m a comedian. I\\u2019m a comedian because I tell dark jokes. I\\u2019m kind of fucked up, all right? I\\u2019ve always been this way. I can\\u2019t really help myself. It gets me into trouble a lot. I lose friends. It\\u2019s ruined relationships with people in my family. For instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. I did love her very much. She was a big fan of mine. And I was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. Horrible mistake. No one should ever ask me to speak at anyone\\u2019s funeral. I asked a friend for advice. Was like, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?\\u201d \\u201cAnthony, just go up there and tell a story. Find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. And don\\u2019t tell a joke. Try not to.\\u201d So I walked up and was like, \\u201cYou know what my favorite memory was? When I was like four years old, before I learned to read, Grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this Southern accent, and she would read to me. She would read Mark Twain to me, and I loved it. Like\\u2026 Mark Twain out of my grandma\\u2019s mouth, it would just come to life.\\u201d And then I couldn\\u2019t help myself. I said, \\u201cAnd I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the \\u2018N\\u2019 word.\\u201d Now I promise you\\u2026 I promise you\\u2026 until you\\u2019ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife\\u2019s funeral\\u2026 \\u2026at a Methodist Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi\\u2026 you are not a real comedian. I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I\\u2019m one of the best comedians of all time. But here\\u2019s the thing. It doesn\\u2019t matter if you believe me. It really doesn\\u2019t matter. The important thing is that I would pass a lie detector test. I like to test myself. I like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. One of my favorite ways to test myself, I like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. The day they happen. I don\\u2019t believe in too soon. I\\u2019m on a tight schedule. And I\\u2019m good at it. I\\u2019m good at it. Like, the day of\\u2026 the day of the Aurora, Colorado Batman movie theater shooting. The day it happened, I went online, I went on Twitter, and I tweeted \\u201cOther than that, how was the movie?\\u201d Right? Right? Nailed it. Nailed it. And the reason I get away with that\\u2026 the reason I get away with stuff like that is I\\u2019m just the guy who does it. People are used to it from me. It would be weird if I didn\\u2019t make a joke the day of a tragedy. Which is why I was very surprised when I got in a lot of trouble the day of the Boston Marathon. Now, I don\\u2019t follow the news regularly. But I know the second a tragedy happens because I get 25 text messages saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t do it.\\u201d And whenever I see that\\u2026 whenever I see that, it makes me sad. It makes me sad \\u2019cause I know something horrible has happened. People will say, \\u201cAnthony, what\\u2019s funny about Aurora? What\\u2019s funny about the Boston Marathon? What\\u2019s funny about your grandmother\\u2019s funeral?\\u201d Nothing! Nothing is funny about those things. That\\u2019s where I come in. So I see these texts and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, no, what happened?\\u201d But I also think, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a job to do.\\u201d So I go online, I start reading about it. I don\\u2019t want to watch the footage. But I\\u2019ll read about what happened. And I think, \\u201cHow can I make someone laugh today?\\u201d And then I think, \\u201cI got it.\\u201d I go back on Twitter. And I tweet, \\u201cGuys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.\\u201d \\u201cEspecially the finish line.\\u201d And again, I think, \\u201cNailed it. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\u201d But then my phone starts to ring. And it\\u2019s my boss. Or should I say my former boss. And they say, \\u201cAnthony, this is unacceptable. You are not just a comedian today. You\\u2019re also the host of your own TV show, with your name in the title, on our network. You take this joke down right now or you\\u2019re fired.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cGo fuck yourselves.\\u201d And I meant it. I didn\\u2019t get into comedy for money or fame. I know that sounds wrong, because I\\u2019m dripping with both. I only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. And they said\\u2026 Sure. They said, \\u201cWell, Anthony, you don\\u2019t understand. You don\\u2019t understand at all. If you don\\u2019t take this joke down right now, if you don\\u2019t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they\\u2019re also out of a job.\\u201d And I\\u2019m ashamed to tell you this. I\\u2019m embarrassed to admit it. But in that moment, I folded, and I deleted the joke. \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m happy to fight for what I believe in. I\\u2019m happy to take the consequences for what I\\u2019ve done. But what I could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, \\u201cHey, buddy, no work for you on Monday. I had this sweet tweet.\\u201d Couldn\\u2019t do it. But as soon as I hit delete, I got mad and I regretted it. I would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, I\\u2019ll tell ya that. And I got mad for betraying myself and everything I believe in. I\\u2019m just as mad today as I was then. Just as mad. So mad, I had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cAnthony, we\\u2019re family. Why are you so upset? Can\\u2019t you see we did you a favor? Don\\u2019t you worry about your career?\\u201d Let me ask you, San Francisco, do I seem like I worry about my career? No. You know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? Because if they\\u2019re worried about their money, they wouldn\\u2019t have played the lottery in the first fuckin\\u2019 place. I do not worry about my career. And they said, \\u201cAnthony, the problem is when you make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you\\u2019re making fun of the victims, and that\\u2019s wrong.\\u201d But that\\u2019s not what I\\u2019m doing. Because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I\\u2019m wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. No one is ever\\u2026 No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, \\u201cHey, are we trending?\\u201d No. This is who I\\u2019m making fun of when I make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: \\u201cMy thoughts and prayers\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cMy thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.\\u201d \\u201cMy thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.\\u201d Do you know what that\\u2019s worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t forget about me today.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t forget about me.\\u201d \\u201cLots of crazy distractions in the news, but don\\u2019t forget how sad I am.\\u201d Those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. They\\u2019re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. You understand? Now I\\u2019m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. It\\u2019s fine. It\\u2019s embarrassing, but it\\u2019s fun. You can laugh at yourself. It\\u2019s not a reason to stop telling jokes. Maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. Trust me, that\\u2019s fun too. You guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? Well, I guess that\\u2019s what makes me me. On my television show, I once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called \\u201cShark Party.\\u201d All right? Now\\u2026 Some of you enjoyed it, but if you\\u2019ve never seen \\u201cShark Party,\\u201d you can never see \\u201cShark Party.\\u201d It\\u2019s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so I will explain it to you. I love sharks. I love sharks more than anything. People\\u2026 People I can barely fucking tolerate. Every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. Every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? So when I hear about a shark attack, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFuck, yeah.\\u201d Win one for the home team. So as soon as I get this show where I can do what I want, I say, \\u201cYou know what? I want to have a shark party. As soon as there\\u2019s a shark attack, we\\u2019re having a shark party.\\u201d And I get lucky. About a month into my run, this guy from New Zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. And I know exactly what to do. I\\u2019ve already got the script written. I walk on stage, in front of the cameras. I say, \\u201cLadies and gentlemen, this guy from New Zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. It\\u2019s time for a shark party.\\u201d Lights go down, music comes up. Six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. For way too long. A stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. Very tasteful. And then I stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. Which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. But I get to say my favorite thing I\\u2019ve ever said on television: \\u201cSmile, you son of a bitch. Shark party.\\u201d And in America, where I\\u2019m famous for those types of shenanigans\\u2026 everybody was like, \\u201cAnthony, that was fucked up.\\u201d \\u201cIt was fucked up to see you dance.\\u201d End of controversy. However, in New Zealand, where they don\\u2019t get my show, they\\u2019ve never seen me, and frankly, they don\\u2019t get out much\\u2026 the New Zealand media takes the video\\u2026 and they show it to the guy\\u2019s family. And they say, \\u201cWhat do you guys think about this?\\u201d And they say, \\u201cCrikey,\\u201d or whatever the fuck they say over there. The point is, all of New Zealand, all of New Zealand rises up against me. All 45 of those cunts rise up. And start threatening my life. Now, I don\\u2019t read the things that people write about me on the Internet. But I pay people who do. And they come to me, and they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve got some terrible news. Please sit down.\\u201d They say, \\u201cYou are getting a lot of death threats online from New Zealand because of \\u2018Shark Party.'\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cReally? New Zealand wants to kill me? That\\u2019s weird because they didn\\u2019t even kill the shark.\\u201d I said, \\u201cHow many death threats am I getting?\\u201d And they were like \\u201cOh, all of them. You are getting all of the death threats. What do you want us to do? We can send someone to talk to them. Extra security? What do you want?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo, forget about it. Leave it alone, don\\u2019t worry.\\u201d This might be hard for some to understand. I\\u2019ve said it several times tonight. Everyone is going to die. I know full well I am going to die. And most of us don\\u2019t get to choose how we check out. But if I die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? Best case scenario. If somebody murders me over one of my jokes, I immediately become a legend. I\\u2019m a comedy God. The Mount Rushmore of comedy is me, four times. I said, \\u201cCome on then.\\u201d My security guys are like, \\u201cOkay, Anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we\\u2019ve ever heard.\\u201d \\u201cBut you\\u2019re the boss. Okay.\\u201d And they leave. And then the next day they come back. And they say \\u201cAnthony, sorry to bother you again. I know you didn\\u2019t care yesterday, but it\\u2019s gotten much worse. You\\u2019re gonna wanna hear this.\\u201d They say, \\u201cSomeone from New Zealand tracked down your mom and dad\\u2019s phone number and address in Pittsburgh, posted that online\\u2026 and now your entire family is getting death threats from New Zealand.\\u201d And I have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. It never crossed my mind\\u2026 that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm\\u2019s way, for something I\\u2019ve done or I\\u2019ve joked about. And honestly, I would cut my throat for my jokes. I would give my life for what I do. But if anyone, and I mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone I cared about because of a joke I\\u2019ve made? Even better. This man is fantastic\\nI watched the show 10 times  and I laughed so much everytime Except for the Eric Clapton joke and Sharky Party all is forgivable.  Great material. So a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is okay but a joke about a famous musician\\u2019s son falling to his death isn\\u2019t?  Where are your priorities? They\\u2019re just jokes.  It\\u2019s just syllables formed together.  They\\u2019re just words. People are monsters, these are just words Your email address will not be published.

[crowd cheering] [upbeat music playing] [crowd continues cheering] [music fades] Thank you. Thank you, Hawaii! I\\u2019m turning 38, so I\\u2019m harvesting my wife\\u2019s eggs this year. I\\u2019m harvesting my wife\\u2019s eggs so that we can make embryos, so we can freeze the embryos, so that we do not have to have kids right now because kids are what you have when you\\u2019ve given up on your own hopes and dreams. [crowd laughing] I\\u2019m still trying here! I look at my friends who are my age who have kids, and they all look like shit. [crowd laughing] It\\u2019s gotten to the point where I can\\u2019t even take a photo with them and post it on my main grid because it messes up the aesthetics of my Instagram too much. With their fucking haggard faces. Just drooping, wrinkly crow\\u2019s-feet-embedded heads. Receding hairlines. Just withering, graying hair coming out in clumps. Because of their children. Like, I did a show, and someone I went to high school with in Singapore came to the show, and after the show, I met up with them, and they brought another person with them, and I was like, \\u201cOh, is this other person your mom?\\u201d \\u201cThank you so much for bringing your mother to my show.\\u201d And that other person was also someone I went to high school with. [crowd laughing] That\\u2019s how fucking ugly\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026these people have become because of their children. Just unrecognizable. So I\\u2019m trying to use money and science to push the curve back a little bit. And, um, first step of harvesting my wife\\u2019s eggs is, I have to inject my wife twice a day for two weeks. So, I have to inject my wife. I am the one injecting my wife twice a day for two weeks. Zero medical training. I was given no medical training whatsoever. The government lets you do this. The\\u2026 The doctor asked me to do it. The doctor was like, \\u201cHey, have you ever held a needle before?\\u201d \\u201cNo? Perfect, here, take this, and inject your wife in the middle of her body, like Nicolas Cage in The Rock.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cTwice a day for two weeks with chemicals that we mail to you.\\u201d \\u201cMystery chemicals that we send to your house in unmarked brown boxes.\\u201d \\u201cJust trust us that it\\u2019s the right thing that you\\u2019re injecting into the person you love the most.\\u201d Internet chemicals that show up\\u2026 It comes in a powder! I have to make it into a liquid, you understand? It\\u2019s a meth lab in my kitchen as I\\u2019m mixing\\u2026 the comp\\u2026 I\\u2019m sweating the whole time \\u2019cause I\\u2019m scared I\\u2019ll fuck up the measurements and kill my wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely, then you have to, like\\u2026 The air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements. And then you have to put it in the syringe. Then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude like you know what you\\u2019re doing. [crowd laughing] [scattered applause] I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing! I saw someone do this on Doogie Howser. [crowd laughing] [crowd whooping] I don\\u2019t even know the angle to put it into her. [chuckling] Like, it looks so painful going in, like\\u2026 I love my wife so much I can\\u2019t even bear to watch her in pain. I couldn\\u2019t even bear to watch the needle go into her. I had to inject my wife like this. I had to, like, cover my eyes, and, like, backhand it\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026into her like Kurosawa. [imitates sword slash] \\u201cDid I get the middle of your body?\\u201d \\u201cNo?\\u201d \\u201cOkay, just walk into the needle!\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cI\\u2019m supposed to do all the work here? Meet me halfway.\\u201d And, uh, the doctor said, \\u201cIf you do everything right, if you\\u2026 measure correctly, you inject at the right times, they scan, like, this part of her body, you know, that Chicago Bulls logo. Right? And they were like\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026\\u201dIf you do everything right, based on what we can tell, you should expect 15 eggs.\\u201d [inhales] And my wife ended up getting 26. [scattered whooping and applause] Yeah. Always a\\u2026 [applause] Yeah, always like a late, half-hearted response to\\u2026 [crowd laughing] Usually, the women in the crowd are like, \\u201cWhoo, yeah.\\u201d All the men in the crowd are always like\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u201cIs that a good number?\\u201d \\u201cIs 26 a good number of eggs?\\u201d \\u201cHow many eggs equal one bebe?\\u201d \\u201cIs it four eggs is one bebe?\\u201d \\u201cSo 26 eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together\\u2026\\u201d Let me put this in a language that men can understand, okay? Twenty-six eggs from one vagina, in one cycle, is MVP numbers. [crowd laughing] Twenty-six eggs is like, if Magic Johnson averaged the triple-double and killed his own AIDS. [crowd laughing] Okay? That\\u2019s the level of medical miracle that\\u2019s happening in whatever this part of my wife\\u2019s body, that horn of the bull that, like, curls into itself. The doctor, like, scraped out 26 eggs out of my wife\\u2019s vagina, like salmon roe. Just scooping out. Just dripping out, and then you put it in some nigiri, right? And then you eat it. That\\u2019s how babies are made. You gotta Salt Bae the eggs onto the ikura, and then you eat it. So, uh, we\\u2019re trying to make embryos. So, eggs, that\\u2019s just half the equation. I don\\u2019t know if you know how embryos are made, but eggs, that\\u2019s just half of it. She did her part admirably. So now I have to contribute my half of the embryo equation. So I\\u2019m sitting in the doctor\\u2019s office. [exhales] Like a wet pigeon, all right? And the doctor comes over. And the doctor\\u2019s a woman because of course she is. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cGood morning, Mr. Chieng.\\u201d \\u201cSo, um, when\\u2019s the last time you ejaculated?\\u201d My wife is right here, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, when is the last time you ejaculated?\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cWe would all like to know.\\u201d It\\u2019s the one time in life where you\\u2019re not allowed to lie about jerking off. It\\u2019s when a medical professional is asking you a direct question. And it\\u2019s for reproduction. It\\u2019s for the intended purpose, so you gotta tell the truth. So I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhatever, I\\u2019ll tell the truth.\\u201d \\u201cUh, let me check my calendar, uh\\u2026\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cI guess the last time I ejaculated was, um\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cLet me see\\u2026 Uh, yesterday, around 3:00 p.m.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And my wife is like, \\u201cYesterday\\u2026 I was with you all day.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And I was like, \\u201cYeah, but remember when you took out the trash?\\u201d [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] Because I also put up MVP numbers. Against a shot clock. And heavy defensive pressure. But I was thinking of you the whole time. It\\u2019s really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever Vietnamese people eat. My wife is Vietnamese. I\\u2019ve no idea what the fuck she eats. N\\u01b0\\u1edbc m\\u1eafm. [chuckles] And I went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off. It\\u2019s the medical jerking-off room. Every hospital has a medical jerking-off room. Okay? It\\u2019s nondescript, not a lot of signage. Smaller than I think it should be. Lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt. And I\\u2019m sitting in a medical jerking-off room. By myself. And there\\u2019s grown men outside the door, waiting for me to finish\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026so they, too, can use the medical jerking-off room that we are sharing like a WeWork. [crowd laughing] And I\\u2019m in a medical jerking-off room by myself. And\\u2026 I couldn\\u2019t go! Okay? Sorry! Sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand. I\\u2019m sorry! Sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me! Sorry! Sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters, as they code to death painfully, and the families crying in the waiting room wasn\\u2019t turning me on. [crowd laughing] So I couldn\\u2019t go. I couldn\\u2019t go. So I just call 911, right? I\\u2019m like\\u2026 [chuckles] [crowd laughing] I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThese people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room.\\u201d Uh, I call the doctor back in, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDoc, I can\\u2019t go.\\u201d \\u201cOkay? I can\\u2019t medically ejaculate under these circumstances.\\u201d \\u201cThe vibes are off.\\u201d \\u201cLet me go home. Let me go home to medically ejaculate. Can I do that?\\u201d And the doctor\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, you can go home, but, you know, as soon as it comes out of your body, it expires quicker than avocados in Hawaii, alright?\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got\\u2026\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cYou have, like, a 45-minute window before there\\u2019s like an exponential decreasing probability of\\u2026\\u201d [gibberish] I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, fine.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll go home, I\\u2019ll medically ejaculate, I\\u2019ll come back in 45 minutes, no problem.\\u201d So I go home, open the front door, ejaculate immediately. Alright? This is\\u2026 [crowd laughing] Alright? This is home court advantage. I know where everything is, I know what\\u2019s behind me. I look at the dripping garbage bag. [crowd laughing] It\\u2019s like a Pavlovian response at this point. Um\\u2026 I ejaculate into a cup. Okay? It\\u2019s a cup that they gave me. It\\u2019s not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen. [crowd laughing] That says, \\u201cWorld\\u2019s Best Dad\\u201d on it. [chuckles] It\\u2019s the cup that they use\\u2026 doctors give you to test your pee for drugs. It\\u2019s got a really tight cap, right? So, I ejaculate into the cup. It keeps overflowing, so I gotta keep, like, pouring it out. [crowd laughing] Just overwhelming amounts. [crowd laughing] It\\u2019s like Ghostbusters 2 up in here. [crowd laughing] [chuckling] I fill it to the brim, and then I scrape off the top, and then I\\u2026 And then I seal the cap as tight as I can, right? Get it really nice and tight. And then I\\u2026 I put it inside my T-shirt, next to my skin, under my armpit. Nice and snug. Because the doctor told me to do that. Because apparently, like the Titanic, your body heat will keep your people alive. And then I run downstairs, and I jump into a New York City taxi, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cTake me to Langone Hospital, please. Hurry up.\\u201d The taxi driver is like, \\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing with your hand?\\u201d \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, yeah, no, I\\u2019m fine.\\u201d \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s not me. It\\u2019s my\\u2026 my wife. She\\u2019s wait\\u2026 A person\\u2026 It\\u2019s my jizz.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And New York City taxis have seen much worse. So, the taxi driver was like, \\u201cOh, okay, cool.\\u201d \\u201cThank you for using a cup.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cUnlike the last two dudes who were back there.\\u201d Just raw dogging at the JFK, you know what I\\u2019m saying? And, uh, we get to the\\u2026 we get to the hospital, right? I open the taxi door. I run into the hospital. And because it\\u2019s New York City, someone on the sidewalk is like, \\u201cHey, yo! Hey, yo!\\u201d \\u201cWere you that guy in Shang-Chi?\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cAm I\\u2026 Yes, I was a minor character in the Marvel movie Shang-Chi, not the main guy.\\u201d And the guy\\u2019s like, \\u201cYo! Yo! Can I get a photo with you?\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, sure.\\u201d [crowd laughing] So, we take a photo like this. So, someone on the internet has a photo of me and this stranger. And I\\u2019m doing this. Like Napoleon. If you ever come across this photo, just know I am holding my own jizz. [crowd laughing] So feel free to tag it. [crowd laughing] He was very grateful. He was like, \\u201cAw, thanks so much, man.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo problem, man.\\u201d I shake his hand, right? [crowd laughing] Because I love meeting my fans. And I run into the hospital, right? Already hitting the 45-minute mark. End of the fourth quarter. There\\u2019s no time left on the clock. So I just take my jizz and I just throw a buzzer-beater. Right? The doctor, like, catches my jizz, like\\u2026 [crowd laughing] Like Odell Beckham. She just, like, one hand, grabs it, and, like, in the same motion, without even putting it down, she, like, alley-oops my jizz into my wife\\u2019s eggs, right? Just takes it, and she goes, \\u201cBoom, shaka-laka!\\u201d And, uh, my sperm goes into my wife\\u2019s eggs, and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg. Nobody knows. It\\u2019s a mystery. It\\u2019s a mystery of the universe. Nobody knows. When sperm goes into the egg, it\\u2019s unknowable. Ooh, it\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s like the event horizon on a black hole. No one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg. Sometimes, nothing happens. When sperm goes into the egg, sometimes, it becomes a bubble tea. [crowd laughing] Nobody knows where bubble tea comes from. It\\u2019s \\u201ctapioca.\\u201d The sperm goes into the egg, and then you shake it, and you go to Vegas, you throw it on the crap table\\u2026 And if you\\u2019re lucky, if you get a good dice roll, right? It becomes a blastocyst. That\\u2019s what we call future humans, blastocysts. It becomes embryos. The doctor, she\\u2019ll take all the embryos and she\\u2019ll look at them under the microscope, and she\\u2019ll grade the embryos. Like cocaine. [crowd laughing] She\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cOoh, yeah, these ones? These are A-grade embryos right here.\\u201d [snorting] [crowd laughing] \\u201cThese ones, these are\\u2026 these are B-grade embryos, so\\u2026 so I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cThese\\u2026 These ones? These are C-grade embryos\\u2026\\u201d [grumbles] \\u201cOh, and these ones?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, these\\u2026 these are\\u2026 These are D-grade embryos.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, these\\u2026 These will storm the Capitol someday.\\u201d Alright? So\\u2026 [crowd laughing] You don\\u2019t want that. And then\\u2026 [crowd cheering] And then you have to, like, draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics. And you don\\u2019t know. You\\u2019re just projecting data. You just hope you\\u2019re not throwing away a Tom Brady in the 12th round that\\u2019s going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you can\\u2019t measure the human spirit. And, uh, we all like to think we\\u2019re good people in this room, but we\\u2019re all picking the A-grade embryos, okay? No one here is not picking your A-grade embryos if given a choice. Even if you were a B-grade embryo. [crowd laughing] You would still pick your A-grade embryos. Because you\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cI know what it\\u2019s like.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not putting my kids through this B-grade human existence, with sweaty palms and sciatica.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cGive me the A-grade shit. Give me the best we could do.\\u201d \\u201cGive my kid a fighting chance.\\u201d And it got me thinking about the future a little bit because I never wanted kids. I never thought I would have kids. The only thing I ever wanted to do my whole life was this. Stand-up comedy in America. [crowd cheering] It\\u2019s the best. Look at this. It\\u2019s the best. You are cheering because you know this is way better than having kids. [crowd laughing] [crowd whooping] So much more fun and lucrative. Well, the blastocysts are real now. There\\u2019s eight of them waiting for me in the cloud. Um\\u2026 33% chance of successful implantation with grade-A embryos. So, I guess that makes me a mass murderer in Alabama. It got me thinking about the future. What kind of parent am I gonna be? Am I gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were, or am I gonna be better than my parents were? Be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck you\\u2019re supposed to be now, and\\u2026 Thinking about it, turns out I\\u2019m gonna be just as bad as my parents were. I can\\u2026 I can feel it. I can feel it inside me. I can feel the\\u2026 I can feel the Chinese inside me. I can just feel that high expectation, just low tolerance for excuses. It\\u2019s in here. It\\u2019s right in here. It\\u2019s like the default app. You know, you can\\u2019t delete the calculator app. There\\u2019s no \\u201cX.\\u201d When you shake it, there\\u2019s no \\u201cX.\\u201d You can move it off the home screen, but it\\u2019s still in the OS, embedded. [crowd laughing] In the operating system, I can feel the Chinese. If my blastocyst was real, if it entered this reality, and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever. \\u201cOh my God, look at this blastocyst.\\u201d \\u201cEverybody, look. Look at how beautiful this blastocyst is.\\u201d \\u201cI love you so much, blastocyst.\\u201d \\u201cI love you much more than I thought I would.\\u201d [kisses] And your blastocyst is hugging you back, right, they\\u2019re like\\u2026 [in child\\u2019s voice] \\u201cI love you too, Daddy.\\u201d \\u201cDaddy, Daddy.\\u201d \\u201cWhen I grow up, I want to be a stand-up comedian.\\u201d \\u201cJust like you.\\u201d [crowd laughing] I just feel the Chinese coming on, right? I just\\u2026 [crowd laughing] You take your glasses off like Hitler in the bunker. [crowd laughing] \\u201cStand-up comedy? Are you out of your fucking mind?!\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cThat\\u2019s not even a real job!\\u201d \\u201cWhat do you think is gonna happen?\\u201d \\u201cJust gonna run around America and tell jokes to strangers who don\\u2019t give a fuck about your mental health?\\u201d \\u201cAnd even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds, and make it to even a semi-professional level as a stand-up comedian, do you think there\\u2019s any chance in hell you\\u2019ll be funnier than me?!\\u201d [crowd laughing] [applause] [crowd cheering] \\u201cDad is a borderline arena act in some markets!\\u201d \\u201cHave you seen my IMDb page?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m in everything! I will fucking crush your career!\\u201d Osoto gari! \\u201cYour mother and I just spent a fortune to make an A-grade blastocyst for them to become a B-grade comedian.\\u201d \\u201cI will never watch anything you do.\\u201d \\u201cGo to law school!\\u201d [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] Is what my father said to me. [crowd laughing] I do think it\\u2019s tough for straight men in 2024 to sincerely look up self-improvement on the internet without five weeks later storming the Capitol, okay? That men\\u2019s self-help YouTube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now. Okay? I\\u2019m not saying it\\u2019s the biggest problem in the world. Clearly. But it is a problem, okay? Because men were genetically predisposed to seek self-improvement. Okay? We\\u2019re trying to be better people every day. Believe it or not, women. [crowd laughing] Once we hit a certain age, okay? Usually we die before then. Through suicide or environmental factors. BMX biking, dietary choices\\u2026 But if you can live long enough as a man, you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective, okay? You start seeking guidance from outside sources. You start looking at watches. Like\\u2026 Like every man in this room has or will at some point. We\\u2019ve all been there. Guys, we\\u2019ve all done this. We\\u2019ve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives. And we\\u2019ve been like, \\u201cWhat a fucking piece of shit.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cI fucking hate this loser.\\u201d \\u201cLook at this loser.\\u201d \\u201cFuck this loser. I hate this person.\\u201d \\u201cI need to be a better person.\\u201d \\u201cLet me start by getting fit.\\u201d [crowd laughing] [woman screams] \\u201cLet me work on my health.\\u201d \\u201cThat seems like a logical place to start my journey.\\u201d \\u201cLet me control what I can control in here.\\u201d So what do you do as a man? You go on YouTube, right? You look up how to lift weights. Right? You press \\u201cEnter.\\u201d You click on the first video. It\\u2019s some guy doing kettlebell swings, right? He\\u2019ll teach you how to lock your core so you don\\u2019t break your fucking spine. And then you do that for two days. You feel pretty good about yourself. [man] Whoo! Right? And on the third day, the same YouTube channel has a new video notification alert, The men are like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s this new video from kettlebell-swinging guy?\\u201d \\u201cWhat could he be doing in his new video?\\u201d In the video, the kettlebell-swinging guy, he\\u2019s doing the new kettlebell exercise. \\u201cThe lawnmower.\\u201d He\\u2019s doing that. And then, like 30 seconds into the video, he just, suddenly, just stops. And he looks really sad. And he puts the kettlebell down. And he looks straight into the camera. And he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYo, guys, just real talk for a second, all right?\\u201d [sniffles] \\u201cKettlebells are great, but I just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And all the men watching this are like, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d [sniffles] \\u201cYeah, that makes sense.\\u201d \\u201cThat feels right, in here.\\u201d \\u201cTell me more, kettlebell-swinging guy.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cWhat other advice do you have for all areas of my life?\\u201d \\u201cIncluding my relationships and financial investments.\\u201d \\u201cPlease give me guidance, kettlebell-swinging guy.\\u201d So what do you do? You watch his next video on autoplay. Then you watch his next video. Here comes the YouTube algorithm with a suggested video. And here comes another suggested video. And a week later, Jordan Peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men. [crowd laughing] Five weeks later, you\\u2019re storming the Capitol dressed like a buffalo. [crowd laughing] [applause] [crowd cheering] That\\u2019s a very realistic sequence of events, by the way. That\\u2019s not even an exaggerated timeline. Every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm. We all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that men\\u2019s self-help, Andrew Tate masculinity, YouTube self-help algorithm. If you don\\u2019t know anyone who lost their mind\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026you\\u2019re the one who lost their mind. You\\u2019re currently in an echo chamber of assholes. \\u2018Cause real friends tell you when you\\u2019re losing your mind. It\\u2019s very tragic. All these men who are trying to be better people, and they\\u2019re seeking guidance. But that YouTube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves. There\\u2019s tragedy in that. Like all those people. They were just trying to lift weights. [crowd laughing] They weren\\u2019t trying to cause an insurrection. They didn\\u2019t even know what that word meant. They were just trying to do this. They\\u2019re trying to do this. They didn\\u2019t know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis-\\u00e0-vis their torso, right? Is it 90 degrees or 45 degrees? Like, is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you\\u2026? They Googled it one time, and then, five weeks later, you\\u2019re taking a shit on Nancy Pelosi\\u2019s desk. [crowd laughing] And the US Marshals are garnishing your wages. Because you take one wrong turn, and life moves pretty quick! I\\u2019m not saying, as a man, don\\u2019t take responsibility for your own actions. Okay? I\\u2019m just saying that YouTube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys. It\\u2026 It sucks men in in a way that I don\\u2019t think women understand. It really preys on that men\\u2019s need to seek guidance from somewhere. It\\u2019s very hard to resist. It just draws\\u2026 draws you in. That\\u2019s why fucking Mark Zuckerberg is trying to MMA fight Elon Musk right now. [crowd laughing] That guy fell for his own algorithm. Do you understand? Mark Zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd. And for, like, 20 years now, he\\u2019s just been looking at our data, right? Jerking off every single day. Just looking at our data, jerking off. Money piling up. Billions of dollars. Data. Jerking off. Money, money, jerking off, data. For 20 years, that loop. And who knew after two decades of that, one day, he just looked at so much data, he was like, \\u201cOh shit, oh shit.\\u201d He fell into it. Now he\\u2019s trying to MMA-fight Elon Musk. That guy jerked off and came on his own face. [crowd laughing] Like, it\\u2019s out of control. Zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality. And he invented that shit, and he still fell for it. What hope does the average man in America have? Just walking\\u2026 Just waddling down the street looking\\u2026 looking for a taco on his phone. He\\u2019s gonna get sucked into his phone. He has no chance. That fucking guy has no chance. Because even the good guys in this room\\u2026 we\\u2019re all, like, on a razor\\u2019s edge to being a piece of shit, okay? [crowd laughing] That margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razor-thin. I gotta tell you. If you have the means, every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge. And you know what? An Instagram post could push it either way! [crowd laughing] Okay? It depends on the post. Was it cute animals or was it boobs? [crowd laughing] That\\u2019s gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours. I do think, as a society, we need to, uh, do a better job of identifying, like, when we have a disagreement with someone who\\u2019s genuinely trying to have a good-faith discussion to reach higher understanding, and who\\u2019s just talking shit. We are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit, and we\\u2019re not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics. Like, for example, me, right now, I\\u2019m just talking shit, okay? [crowd laughing] This is one-way shit-talking. I don\\u2019t care about any of your opinions. Do not send me any of them. I do not care. You paid for me. I didn\\u2019t pay a cent for any of you, okay? [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] Free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shit-talking session. If you don\\u2019t like it, take it out on Adam Smith. But if I was having a conversation with someone I disagree with, in good faith, I would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with. That\\u2019d be a logical place to start a difficult conversation. For example, MAGA. Make America Great Again. They have a point. America\\u2019s not doing so great right now. Right? Our kids\\u2019 math scores are down. [crowd laughing] Our children\\u2019s science scores are down. When judged according to international metrics, uh, healthcare systems not doing so great. Wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially. There was an implied promise to a generation of Americans that if you do certain things, work hard, go to college, be a good person, you would have certain outcomes. And those outcomes didn\\u2019t materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decision-making positions lowered the capital gains tax\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year. In post-World War II, US leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for National Security by making the US dollar the default international trade currency, which gave America the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a US financial banking system, but consequently increased the value of the US dollar astronomically, which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in America. [inhales deeply] Although the logic at the time\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026was that Americans were supposed to upskill en masse, away from the menial manufacturing jobs, but everyone here\\u2019s too much of a dumbass to stay school, so we just traded domestic manufacturing to Asia and the rest of the world at the expense of working-class families. But if you don\\u2019t read enough\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026it comes out as, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go, Brandon!\\u201d [crowd laughing] And it\\u2019s like, you have a point, but you don\\u2019t have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didn\\u2019t read enough. You gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag. There\\u2019s a book behind the word. You gotta keep going. You can go at your own pace, but you gotta finish the required reading. Otherwise, we can\\u2019t have a conversation. We\\u2019re all catching up to each other. I\\u2019m friends with MAGA. I\\u2019m friends with the MAGAs. Some of them are my good friends. [man] Whoo! Yeah. Hawaii MAGA. [crowd laughing] The friendliest of all MAGA. [crowd laughing] Aloha MAGA. They\\u2019re in Hawaii right now, Making Aloha Great Again. I became friends with them because I filmed two seasons of a TV show in Hawaii, Doogie Kame\\u0101loha, on Disney+. [crowd cheering] [applause] MAGA Hawaii welcomed me into their homes. \\u201cRonny, please, come over. Please, we\\u2019re having a barbecue.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019d love you to meet the family, meet the ohana, please.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019d love to have you over.\\u201d So gracious. You show up, they\\u2019re so warm and welcoming. \\u201cThanks for coming. Take whatever you want.\\u201d \\u201cThere\\u2019s some Kalua pork, there\\u2019s some loco mocos, hot dogs.\\u201d \\u201cHey. Here. Here.\\u201d \\u201cTouch my gun.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cTouch it. Just touch\\u2026 Just take it.\\u201d I\\u2019m always like, \\u201cI\\u2026 I don\\u2019t want to touch any of these guns, okay?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t know where they\\u2019ve been. I don\\u2019t know where they\\u2019re going.\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t have time in my schedule to attend depositions.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cJust give me the loco moco.\\u201d [crowd laughing] Very passionate people, my MAGA friends. And I respect their passion to some extent. I do. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI love America. I would die for this country.\\u201d And I believe them. I believe they love America, and I believe they would die for this country, which is very admirable. But it\\u2019s like, man, you are willing to die for your country. Why aren\\u2019t you willing to learn math? [crowd laughing] Also for your country, like\\u2026 Like, do both for your country. I know you wanna die for your country, but we\\u2019re losing the engineering jobs to Asia right now. So if you\\u2026 We need less people to die for their country. We need more people to do their homework for their country. Like, do your homework for your country. Like, actually sit down and show the work, and, like, do the\\u2026 That\\u2019s a more efficient way to show your patriotism. If you take that \\u201cI want to die\\u201d energy and you put it into homework, you will fucking top the school, I\\u2019m telling you. It\\u2019s\\u2026 Sky\\u2019s the limit. [crowd cheering] Dude, you\\u2019ll\\u2026 you\\u2019ll solve a lot of problems, you\\u2019ll create a lot of jobs, you\\u2019ll increase the GDP. Just do\\u2026 do your homework for your country. \\u201cI\\u2019d rather die!\\u201d [crowd laughing] I\\u2026 I thought so. I thought that might be\\u2026 I thought that might be the case. Dying\\u2019s easy, math is hard. [crowd laughing] These quadratic equations making me suicidal. Uh, we try not to talk about politics, my MAGA friends and I, out of mutual respect. Inevitably, it comes up. Some stuff I\\u2019m wrong about, some stuff they\\u2019re right about, but sometimes, like, their messaging is so convoluted. Like, I can\\u2019t get to what their core issue actually is, because their surface messaging is so chaotic. Like, sometimes they\\u2019re like, \\u201cRonny, China caused COVID, but COVID isn\\u2019t real.\\u201d [crowd laughing] So, is it fine then? Does it mean it\\u2019s fine? I don\\u2019t know how to feel about it now. \\u2018Cause one minus one is zero. I don\\u2019t know what to tell you. The\\u2026 The math analogy works for concepts, not just numbers, you can\\u2026 \\u201cX\\u201d is anything. Why are you yelling at me about China? Always yelling at me about China. \\u201cChina is doing this. China did a weather balloon, with a camera.\\u201d \\u201cChina\\u2019s got an artificial island in the Pacific doubling as an aircraft carrier base.\\u201d \\u201cChina\\u2019s doing TikTok. Why is China doing TikTok?!\\u201d I don\\u2019t know. [crowd laughing] I\\u2019m not from China. I\\u2019m from Malaysia. [scoffs] I\\u2019m from Malaysia, not China. I\\u2019m\\u2026 I\\u2019m third-generation Chinese Malaysian. Malaysia. You know Michelle Yeoh? Oscar winner? Malaysia? Yeah, that\\u2019s Malaysia. Sama-sama. Malaysia. Saya anak Malaysia. Malaysia. Malaysia, not China. Malaysia. We are the ones who lost the plane. [crowd laughing] Okay? You guys remember that? Did you see the documentary on Netflix, suggested after my special? You guys see that? That was us. [crowd laughing] That was us. We\\u2019re the \\u201close the plane\\u201d people. Okay? We\\u2019re not the human rights whatever\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know\\u2026 TikTok\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know what that is, okay? We\\u2019re the\\u2026 [mimics plane engine] \\u201cAh! Where is it?! Where the fuck is it?!\\u201d That\\u2019s us. Uh, my\\u2026 my MAGA friends all hate US tax. That\\u2019s like a universal party platform. There\\u2019s different types of MAGA, right? There\\u2019s, like, MAGA light, MAGA concentrated, but, like\\u2026 Right, it\\u2019s unfair to group them under one banner, but one uniting party principle is, \\u201cLove America, fuck US tax.\\u201d And I get it. I also hate US tax now that I\\u2019m in the highest bracket. [crowd laughing] Yeah, I\\u2019m MAGA with that. Fuck US tax. Yeah, fuck American tax. Feels good to say it. Like the words give you power, right? Fuck US tax. Fuck American Tax. You like it? You like it when I say it? When this fucking foreigner says it? You like that? Fuck US tax. You like that? You like it when this accent says that? Fuck American tax. You like that? You don\\u2019t see a discrepancy in energy? \\u201cLove America, USA, USA.\\u201d \\u201cFuck US tax.\\u201d Put politics aside for just three seconds. Okay? If it\\u2019s even possible. Just for three seconds, just consider this concept in a vacuum. Just as an academic exercise, okay? When you love something, you give it money. [crowd laughing] Right? Like that\\u2019s one of the primary ways we show love for individuals, organizations, ideas on Kickstarter, sports teams\\u2026 We go like, \\u201cYeah, we give it money.\\u201d So when you go, \\u201cLove America, USA, USA.\\u201d \\u201cFuck US tax.\\u201d So what are you saying? You love America so much, you want it to be poor? You want your country to be poor? You want it to be a beggar on the street. A street beggar. You want your country to be a street beggar on the street? I love my mom. Sometimes I give my mom money. [crowd laughing] Give your mom money sometimes. [man] Yeah! Look how alien this concept is to white people. [crowd laughing] [applause] Just\\u2026 silence. [crowd laughing] Give your mom money sometimes. \\u201cFor what?!\\u201d [crowd laughing] Because she\\u2019s your Ma. [chuckles] And you love her, right? She loves you back, so fucking cut her off a piece every once in a while. Probably tore stuff giving birth to you, cut her a piece of the pie. Arbitrarily, even. Just give a\\u2026 I\\u2019m sure your mother would appreciate it. No matter who your mom is, how self-accomplished she is, I\\u2019m sure your mom could use it. Fix the driveway, invest in infrastructure. Something. [crowd laughing] Sometimes Americans treat their country the way they treat their parents. [indistinct chatter from crowd] Yeah. [crowd laughing] \\u201cI love my mom. I love my mom. I would die for my mom.\\u201d \\u201cBut fuck her, she made her choices.\\u201d [crowd laughing] I love being in America. I do. I love being here. I had my options. I came here. I love being in America because this is the country that puts show business above everything. And I am in the business of show business. So naturally, I\\u2019m gonna come here and do it. I do this in America, \\u201cFuck America. Fuck the president. Fuck US tax,\\u201d money, money just comes into\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u201cFuck the president.\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s too old. Fuck this president.\\u201d The money comes in. Money just comes in. Like printing money. I do this in Malaysia, same\\u2026 same words, same\\u2026 same clothing, same haircut, facing the same direction, in Malaysia? Jail. [crowd laughing] Like, the arbitrage value is out of control. Same product in different loc\\u2026 Obviously, I\\u2019ll do this here. Why the fuck would I do it anywhere else? It\\u2019s the best. I think, uh, sometimes people forget I\\u2019m a first-generation immigrant here. Because my second-generation or later American friends, like, their parents were immigrants. And the way they talk about their parents is so disrespectful. And they forget, like, I\\u2019m also an immigrant. They\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cYou know my parents? They\\u2019re immigrants.\\u201d \\u201cYou know immigrants. They\\u2019re so cheap.\\u201d [crowd laughing] Like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t come over. My family\\u2019s over this weekend. My parents are here.\\u201d \\u201cMy parents are immigrants. You know immigrants. Ugh!\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re so cheap.\\u201d Yo, I want to defend immigrants here for a second, all right? Fuck that shit. Yeah, my mom lives in Singapore. She is not an immigrant. She is still extremely cheap. [crowd laughing] Okay? Being cheap is not an immigrant thing. It\\u2019s genetic. [crowd laughing] Cheap people are cheap. They\\u2019re not choosing to be cheap. It\\u2019s just inside, it\\u2019s not a choice. Chinese baby boomers are cheap \\u2019cause they don\\u2019t know how to have fun. They haven\\u2019t had fun in, like, 50 years. They, like, forgot the energy of fun. Like, of all the Asians right now in the Asian fun hierarchy, from most fun to least fun, Chinese baby boomers, least fun of all the Asians right now. I can say this. I\\u2019m Chinese, okay? You don\\u2019t fucking say it. [crowd laughing] This is our \\u201cN\\u201d word. You don\\u2019t fucking say it. I say it. You don\\u2019t fucking say it. Least fun\\u2026 You don\\u2019t fucking say it. Least fun of all the Asians, Chinese baby boomers. Right now, of all the Asians, most fun Asians, uh, the Koreans, okay? You gotta give it up for the Koreans. [crowd cheering] [crowd laughing] Give it up for the Koreans. You gotta tip your cap and respect the back-to-back championships of the modern-day Koreans just killing it with the fun and the pop culture. They\\u2019re\\u2026 Everyone\\u2019s\\u2026 They\\u2019ve got Blackpink. They got music. They got BTS. [crowd cheering] Dude, BTS is right now in the army fighting Kim Jong-un. [crowd laughing] Do you understand? BTS is at the DMZ right now, just going\\u2026 [singsongs pop beat playfully] [mimics machine gun] [crowd laughing] Just an unstoppable force of entertainment. [chuckling] Taking down countries and dictatorships. They got, uh\\u2026 Koreans got, uh, the Parasite movie, Oscar-winning. They got Past Lives. They got, uh\\u2026 Crash Landing on You. [crowd cheering] Just dominating the Netflix home page of white people. [crowd laughing] Never thought I\\u2019d see the day when white people\\u2019s homepage is full of K-drama. Just binging. Non-stop. They got, uh, Squid Game. Dude, Koreans have more fun dying in Squid Game than Chinese people have at comedy shows. Chinese people at comedy shows, they\\u2019re looking at their phone. \\u201cDo I have to look up?\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s here? Okay, I\\u2019m gonna video for six minutes.\\u201d Full flash video. This is\\u2026 This is how I live in the moment as a Chinese person. Koreans, most fun. Uh, Filipinos know how to have fun. [crowd cheering] Yeah, they love having fun, uh\\u2026 Vietnamese people know how to have fun. Cambodians know how to have fun. Hmong people know how to have fun. Even Japanese know how to have fun. In a reserved way. [crowd cheering] Outwardly stoic. Inside, just anime. [crowd laughing] Outside, unreadable. Inside, just the intro to Sailor Moon. Right? Just\\u2026 [crowd laughing] [humming the intro to Sailor Moon] Outside is just, \\u201cOhayo gozaimasu.\\u201d [crowd laughing] Japanese people have so much fun sometimes they go straight back to work. [crowd laughing] \\u201cYou\\u2019re not gonna change your suit? Just straight into the office? Alright.\\u201d [chuckles] Uh\\u2026 Everyone knows Chinese baby boomers, least fun of all the Asians. Because for Chinese baby boomers, their primary directive in life is, \\u201cDo not get scammed.\\u201d That\\u2019s like the overriding directive that informs the entire decision-making tree. RoboCop, primary directive, \\u201cDo not get scammed.\\u201d \\u201cDo not arrest OCP executive.\\u201d \\u201cDo not get scammed.\\u201d And for Chinese baby boomers, there\\u2019s no value proposition, okay? It\\u2019s just pure price sensitivity. That means any money outgoing is a scam. [crowd laughing] \\u201cIf money leaves my possession, that was a scam!\\u201d [crowd laughing] So the whole time, they\\u2019re just tensed up, they\\u2019re just looking for scams when they go out. They\\u2019re just like\\u2026 They can\\u2019t even relax. \\u201cScam\\u2019s coming!\\u201d It\\u2019ll be a two-drink minimum over here. Parking guys, tip\\u2026 [grumbling] Tensing up. Meanwhile, Koreans in the back just having fun. [crowd laughing] Filipinos dancing like\\u2026 Chinese baby boomers just tensed up. The further they get from their house, as distance X increases, they know the fees will increase and so the ex\\u2026 The expenditures are gonna increase, so they keep tensing up. The further they get, until eventually, like, their whole body tenses up into, like, a \\u201cC,\\u201d right? Like a \\u201cC\\u201d for Chinese. [crowd laughing] And then, in the back you\\u2019re like, \\u201cGo, go, have fun! Have fun!\\u201d They just refuse to have fun. Like, my mom came and visited me in New York City. Her only son, she came to New York City. New York City is the kind of city where, as soon as you open your front door, it\\u2019s like $1.50. Like, if you touch your door knob, it\\u2019s like, Apple Pay $1.50, just going\\u2026 It goes into the universe. My mom came in and approached the front door in New York. She\\u2019s like in the back of the apartment, \\u201cI\\u2019m good, I don\\u2019t need to leave the house today.\\u201d My mom isn\\u2019t even scared of Asian hate. She\\u2019s more scared of inflation. [crowd laughing] She can\\u2019t believe the prices of things anymore. You take her out to Central Park. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go to Central Park, it\\u2019s free.\\u201d \\u201cLook how beautiful New York is in autumn. Look at this.\\u201d \\u201cWhy are these hot dogs five dollars? It\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo, this\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cThe price is right. No one is scamming you.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s the correct amount of money to pay for that.\\u201d \\u201cYou haven\\u2019t been out of the house in 50 years. That number is correct.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s how much things cost after baby boomers destroyed the global financial economy in 2010 pursuing subprime mortgages, okay?\\u201d That\\u2019s\\u2026 That\\u2019s\\u2026 If anything, you scammed yourself. That\\u2019s you scamming yourself. Yeah, \\u201cYou played yourself.\\u201d DJ Khaled. [crowd laughing] My mom came to visit me in Hawaii. Her first time in Hawaii. And if you know Hawaii, locals and the Hawaiians here, the least scammy culture on the planet. Could not be more generous as a community. You get so much more than you give when you\\u2019re on the islands of Hawaii. And, uh, my mom comes, and she lands, and she gets to the hotel, and they welcome her, \\u201cAloha. Welcome to Hawaii.\\u201d And they put a lei over her, like a ring of flowers. They put it over her, and my mom does this. [crowd laughing] \\u201cI\\u2019m not paying for that.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t do that, Mom.\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re not trying to trick you into buying something.\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re trying to welcome you to their homeland.\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re not tricking you into buying just \\u2019cause you touched it.\\u201d \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t Thailand. Just put on\\u2026\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cPut on the lei, you\\u2019re embarrassing me in front of the Hawaiians!\\u201d Mahalo. [crowd laughing] [applause] [crowd cheering] These Chinese baby boomers, most scared of being scammed in real life, the first to get scammed on the internet. For people who live in fear their entire lives, extremely gullible. Because these baby boomers, they don\\u2019t have the\\u2026 they don\\u2019t have the antibodies to deal with the internet. Completely clueless when they go on now. Like, watching baby boomers go on the internet now is like watching babies wandering into the kitchen by themselves, just looking for cookies on the kitchen countertop, just like\\u2026 Running their hands blindly on the kitchen countertop. Pulling down knives. Kitchen knives coming straight down into their eyeballs, into, like, the soft part of their skull. They go in the kitchen, they open the oven, they turn it on. They stick their head inside. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cAny pictures of my grandkids in here?\\u201d \\u201cIs this link safe to click on? Is this link safe to click on?\\u201d \\u201cIs this link safe to click on?\\u201d Just falling for every basic bitch internet scam possible. These fucking baby boomers tumbling into internet scams like pandas rolling down a hill. [crowd laughing] Just jujitsu-rolling into scams every single day. Loving scams. \\u201cOh, what do you want? 20 Target gift cards?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, sounds like a legitimate way to pay for antivirus software on my phone.\\u201d \\u201cEverybody, look. Look at this link. Look, there\\u2019s a\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018What\\u2019s the one trick your doctor doesn\\u2019t want you to know?'\\u201d \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll click on that link.\\u201d \\u201cI knew it. I knew my doctor was scamming me!\\u201d \\u201cThat was a trick he didn\\u2019t want me to know.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna invalidate his medical degree with one click right now!\\u201d [grunts] \\u201cThis is not the scam. My doctor is the scam. Let me\\u2026\\u201d [grunts] Click on this\\u2026 These fucking internet idiot savants who can\\u2019t remember a single goddamn password, but for some reason, can make any piece of misinformation go viral. Like a Russian cyber army, just spreading misinformation around the world in family group WhatsApp chats. Everywhere. \\u201cEverybody, just look at this article. Is this real?\\u201d \\u201cLook at it. Is this real?\\u201d It\\u2019s how they fact-check! They spread it. \\u201cLook at this, this is a real\\u2026? Everybody, weigh in.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not saying a hair dryer in your mouth will kill COVID.\\u201d \\u201cOkay? But what? You can\\u2019t ask questions anymore?\\u201d \\u201cLook at this article from cnn-n-n-n.ru.\\u201d \\u201cQuick, send it to your uncle, send it to your\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cSend it to our whole family tree. Everybody needs to see this.\\u201d Has there ever been a dumber generation of idiots more susceptible to fake news than these fucking baby boomers literally believing everything they see on the internet? I get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last, due to the exponential technology growth curve, okay? But this has got to be the biggest gap in human history! The information asymmetry right now is just out of control. You literally have people in Honolulu right now auto-driving their Tesla Cybertrucks as they vape out the window, and their phone AI is trading cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, you have baby boomers, they can\\u2019t even right-click. [crowd laughing] They can\\u2019t even right-click. \\u201cThere\\u2019s one button! How do you right-click on one button?!\\u201d It\\u2019s scary. They don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s real anymore. \\u201cHey, Ronny. Look at this photo of Bigfoot shopping at Whole Foods.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cBigfoot is real now!\\u201d \\u201cLook, there\\u2019s an image of him buying kombucha at Whole Foods.\\u201d \\u201cWhat technology exists that can fake images?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cMom, that\\u2019s not real. Stop sending it around. It\\u2019s not real.\\u201d \\u201cHow do you know?\\u201d They always get so indignant about it. Like, \\u201cHow do you know that it\\u2019s not real?\\u201d \\u201cHow did you know that?\\u201d Because the font, the font is off and the resolution of the image is blurry, and that lighting state doesn\\u2019t make sense for that image! And that\\u2019s not standard dimensions for a news article. I can\\u2019t give you this knowledge. It\\u2019s like Malcolm Gladwell\\u2019s Blink! I\\u2019ve seen so much shit on the internet, my brain instantly filters it. You\\u2019ll never have this skill set, so just stay off the internet! This world is not for you anymore! Stop making decisions! [crowd cheering and clapping] But anyway, respect your elders. [crowd laughing] It\\u2019s a Confucian value. Maybe if you give your mom some money, she wouldn\\u2019t get scammed so much. Yeah, well\\u2026 Think about the correlation between those two phenomena. Uh\\u2026 People always ask me, like, \\u201cWhy do you shit on your mom for money?\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you shit on your dad for money?\\u201d Alright, uh\\u2026 [chuckles] No, I don\\u2019t talk about my dad because, uh, my dad has no context for show business. Like, we grew up in Malaysia. Like, his families are rubber tappers in Malaysia. My aunts and uncles are still in Sitiawan in Malaysia right now tapping rubber. They have no context for show business. Very smart people, but they don\\u2019t know this world. My dad, he was the first guy in his family to get a college education. He went to Manchester College, which has merged with the University of Southern New Hampshire. He got his master\\u2019s of economics there. Put himself through it. Very smart guy. And he was a good immigrant. He came to America, to New Hampshire, to get his education, and when he graduated, he went back to Malaysia. He didn\\u2019t take anyone\\u2019s job, he left. [crowd laughing] And my dad had the vision to see what I didn\\u2019t see. He knew he had a ceiling on him, because of the way he thinks and talks, and he went back to Malaysia. And he was right! For him. He went back. It was the right choice for him. He became a very successful corporate executive. Uh, he retired to a farm in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Love farming. He retired to a farm. That\\u2019s how much this guy loved it, but he had no context for show business, so he wouldn\\u2019t understand anything I\\u2019m doing. Like, he wouldn\\u2019t understand what I\\u2019m doing in Godzilla vs. Kong. He\\u2019d be like, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you just run that way?\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cDad, I don\\u2019t control the edit. Okay?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m just Honolulu Chinatown shopkeeper No. 3 in this\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cIn this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla, okay?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m just connecting Act 1 to Act 2, I don\\u2019t have a say in how this plays out.\\u201d Because of that, I stopped telling him about what I was doing. I felt he wouldn\\u2019t get it, and he stopped asking me. So I didn\\u2019t tell him I got hired on The Daily Show. He found out the way all parents find out about their kids\\u2019 accolades, through a local newspaper. So, one day, the local paper reported that I got hired on The Daily Show, and he called me immediately. He was like, Ronny, what\\u2019s this I hear about you joining \\u201cThe Everyday Show\\u201d? And I was like, \\u201cOh no, it\\u2019s The Daily Show.\\u201d \\u201cI joined like two years ago, Dad.\\u201d He was like, \\u201cOh, okay. Well, what\\u2019s The Daily Show?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s just like another late-night American talk show.\\u201d \\u201cThey kind of invented modern American satire.\\u201d And\\u2026 [clicks tongue] And, uh, my dad was like, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s cool. Are you the host?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m a correspondent.\\u201d He was like, \\u201cWhat is that? What\\u2019s a correspondent?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, correspondent is, I help the host with comedy segments.\\u201d And he was like, \\u201cOh, okay.\\u201d \\u201cHey, Mei! He\\u2019s just a sidekick.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And so he had, like, no context for what was a win, what was a milestone in this industry. And so, I stopped telling him, and he stopped asking me. And I didn\\u2019t need that from him. We\\u2026 We were totally fine. We\\u2019d talk about other stuff. Not about work. We weren\\u2019t fighting. It was all good. Uh, and he passed away very suddenly, uh, in 2018. He died on Christmas Eve. Died on his farm, like, no warning, no explanation. He just left one day. He left so suddenly, we had to go back to handle his estate. If anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position, when you have to handle someone else\\u2019s estate, it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life. And so it\\u2019s me, my wife, my sister, brother-in-law, went back to Johor Bahru, and part of me trying to figure out his estate was I had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using. So, his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it, and I opened it up, and it\\u2019s password-protected, and I know this guy so well, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHis password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child.\\u201d So\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026I type in my sister\\u2019s birthday, and spot on. Spot on. It was my sister\\u2019s birthday. [crowd laughing] As it should be. She\\u2019s, like, an anesthesiologist in Australia. She\\u2019s like way more respectable person than me, actually saving lives like a good person. Contributing back to society, not like this fucking asshole. I get in\\u2026 [chuckles] I get in trouble on the internet for shit I said two years ago, every six weeks. So it should be her. She should be the favorite. So, I log into his computer, I open his web browser, I look at his browsing history, and the whole time, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cPlease don\\u2019t let me find my dad\\u2019s porn.\\u201d \\u201cPlease don\\u2019t let me find what positions my dad was into.\\u201d \\u201cEven if it was just missionary, I wouldn\\u2019t be able to handle it.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna have to burn this laptop.\\u201d For real Chinese people, when we burn things, it goes to our ancestors, and then my granddad is gonna see it, and it\\u2019s like, I don\\u2019t\\u2026 I don\\u2019t want that for them. I\\u2019ll be fine, but they\\u2019re gonna have an awkward time. I\\u2019m considerate like that, uh\\u2026 So I open the web browser, look at his history, and way to go, Dad, no porn. What a clean-cut guy. No porn. He only went on the internet twice a day. Like clockwork. 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Like the farmer that he was. And every time he went on the internet, he\\u2019d only go to two websites each time. So, the first website he\\u2019d go to was a local news website, and the second website he\\u2019d go to twice a day, every single day, was my Twitter page. [crowd] Aw\\u2026 So, he\\u2019d be reloading my Twitter page twice a day just to see what I was doing. And I post stuff like, \\u201cHey, Honolulu, Hawaii, I sold out five shows, uh, this week, why\\u2019s there so many homeless people here?\\u201d I\\u2019d post stuff like that. [crowd laughing] And, uh\\u2026 he would read that, and then he\\u2019d be like\\u2026 I assume, he\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOh, Ronny\\u2019s doing okay.\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s in Hawaii, he sold out some shows, and oh, I guess there\\u2019s a lot of homeless people in Hawaii.\\u201d Uh, and, um, that was his quiet way of keeping up with me. He never told me that, and I never knew that, and we never discussed it, um, which is a very nice sentiment. Unfortunately, uh, as best as I can tell, this is the last tweet my dad read of mine. [crowd laughing] So, as best as I can tell, forensically, based on internet browsing timestamps, the last tweet my dad read of mine, and quite possibly, the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm, was me posting on Twitter, \\u201cIf you\\u2019re a baby boomer on Twitter, I already know you\\u2019re a fucking loser.\\u201d [crowd laughing] Now, obviously, this was not directed towards him. I didn\\u2019t even know he had Twitter. I didn\\u2019t even know he knew what Twitter was. But I stand by the statement. [crowd laughing] [applause] And I know that\\u2019s kind of a weird way to end the show, but, um\\u2026 [crowd laughing] [chuckles] \\u2026if it\\u2019s any solace, uh, this was his phone when he died. [crowd] Aw! That was his, uh, wallpaper and his screensaver. And\\u2026 [chuckles] And I didn\\u2019t even know. And it\\u2019s a photo of me and my wife, and we\\u2019re in Hawaii. And I\\u2019m wearing two leis \\u2019cause my mom threw one off and I put it on. [crowd laughing] And, uh, I didn\\u2019t know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper. Uh, and\\u2026 [applause] Uh\\u2026 I\\u2026 I like to\\u2026 I like to think that, uh, that is the last image he saw of me. That\\u2019s what he remembered me by when he left. And, uh, I also would like to tell my sister, I won! [crowd laughing] I won! It was me! It was me! You guys have been great. Thanks for coming out, Honolulu.

        "Words like “the”, “I”, and “to” had the most next-word connections—common in spoken English.\n",

        "Tokens like “[crowd laughing]” appeared often, reflecting stand-up performance style.\n",

        "The histogram showed that most words had few next-word options, but a few had many—creating a balance between structure and randomness.\n",
