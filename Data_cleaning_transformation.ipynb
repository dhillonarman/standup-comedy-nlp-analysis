I don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘Cause I’m straight up jealous. I’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right?

My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or I have the kind where my body will heal itself.

I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit.

Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “You never know when you might need this.” And I was like, “But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore.

That was very nice. Thank you. Look, now, you’re a wonderful crowd, but I need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? Because… No, no, no. Thank you. Some crowds… some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. So… I don’t judge those crowds, by the way, okay? We’ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. We’ve all made a “Happy Birthday” sign… Wait. You get that poster board up, and you’re like, “I don’t need to trace it. I know how big letters should be. To begin with, a big-ass ‘H’. Followed by a big-ass ‘A’ and… Oh, no! Oh, God! Okay, all right. Real skinny ‘P’ with a high hump, and then we’ll put the second ‘P’ below the hump of that first ‘P’, sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. And now I have no room for the ‘Y’, so I’ll do a kind of curled-up noodle ‘Y’. Block letters and cursive look good together.” And then you go to write “Birthday” and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with “Happy.” You’re like, “Yeah, but the past is the past. Big-ass ‘B’. Surely more letters will fit in the same space.”',\n",

Though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment I walked out on stage. I don’t give off that vibe. Some people give off a vibe of… Right away, they’re like, “Do not fuck with me.” My vibe is more like, “Hey, you could pour soup in my lap and I’ll probably apologize to you.” When I walk, for real, my feet go out like this. I’m so open and vulnerable. I look like a doll that you point out molestation on. “Show us on this white comedian where the man touched you.”',\n",
              " \"It’s been a while since I’ve been home to Chicago. I got married since then. Thank you. I married my wife. I love saying “my wife.” It sounds so adult. “That’s my wife.” It’s great, you sound like a person. I said it even before we were married. We were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and Anna’s ticket didn’t say anything and my ticket said “priority access.” It doesn’t matter why. But we were getting on and I said, “Uh, can my wife board with me?” And they were like, “Yes, of course. Right this way.” And I was like, “Oh, that is so much better than all those times I was like, ‘Can my girlfriend come?'” And, yeah, I shouldn’t have said it that way, but still. “My wife” just has some kick-ass to it, you know? “Get away from my wife! No one talk to my wife!” Marriage is gonna be very magical. “I didn’t kill my wife!” That’s like, “Ooh, who’s that fella? I bet he did kill his wife.” Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. That’s not really a joke, that’s just a little sweet thing I like to say. ‘Cause I’d been in relationships where I got cheated on, like, long ones. I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. ‘Cause when I was a kid, I used to watch America’s Most Wanted. You know how kids do. And I would always think to myself, “How could another person kill someone? How could a human being kill another human being?” And then I got cheated on, and I was like, “Oh, okay.” “I’m not gonna do it, but I totally get it.” And I don’t mean in that way of, like, “No one else can have you.” I don’t care about that. It’s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. They have a lot of information. Anyone who’s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. I can’t have them roaming around.\",\n",
              " 'I talked to a lot of people before I got engaged, you know. And I heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. This is an old expression. People say this. They say, “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You ever heard that before? It’s a bananas insulting expression… to an entire gender. But also, it makes no sense. “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You’re not allowed to milk a cow that you don’t own. That’s not even a situation. Was that a problem at one point? Like, in the dairy community? Was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? Some Dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, “Ah-ha-ha, I take your milk.” And the farmer was like, “Well, then, this is your cow now.” And he was like, “No, no proof of purchase.” And he ran off into the night. That sounded Dutch, right? You know what that… you know what that expression means? It means, “Why would you marry a woman if she’s already having sex with you?” Which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. Now, it’s like, “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you’re gonna buy it. And… … you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you can’t avoid that question at all. And also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. And the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like… And does not enjoy the sale at all… even though she’s the one that wanted to go to the sale. And she’s especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. “Why buy the cow?” Well, let’s be real here. You’re very lucky to have the cow that you do have. “Roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, John.” By the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and… a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought… They assume it. When you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, “John Mulaney bull?” And if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. They’ll still say it. ‘Cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but… But, for real, Chicago, why buy the cow? Let’s be real. Why buy the cow? Because you love her. You really do. And, yeah, yeah… Sure, she’s a bossy little Jew, but… … she takes care of you. And you don’t wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, “Hey, you seen any loose milk?”',\n",
              " 'My wife is Jewish. She’s a New York Jew. I did it! Now, I was raised Catholic. I don’t know if you can tell that from the everything about me. My wife is Jewish, I grew up Catholic, so we got married by a friend. Being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. “What’s the name of the bishop?” “That’s actually stand-up comedian Dan Levy. He was the host of MTV’s Your Face or Mine?” I saw a lot of Catholic weddings, though, because I was an altar boy… And a hush falls over the room. Isn’t it weird how that became a scandalous thing? That was just some boring shit I had to do on weekends. But now, it’s like saying, “I was a French maid for a period of time. I was treated well in my day. I worked for a variety of sirs.” No, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? You’d serve Mass and then you’d serve weddings sometimes. My brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in Chicago where we grew up. And the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, “Aw, she’s ugly.” And then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. And I know that’s awful, but wouldn’t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? It was the best moment of this stupid woman’s life, and she’s walking down the aisle, and the organ’s like… And she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of God. And right at that second, for no reason at all, some Cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, 13-year-old prick decides to go, “Aw, she’s ugly!” Hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, “Aw, she’s beautiful. She’s enchanting.”',\n",
              " \"I grew up Catholic. I don’t go to church anymore. But I went on Christmas Eve with my parents, ’cause you know how you lie to your parents. So… we go into the church and I was like, “I got this under control.” And then I got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. No, I was going through Mass and I was batting, like, .400. And then in the middle of Mass, the priest said, “Peace be with you.” And everyone said, “And with your spirit.” And I was the one pre-Y2K asshole going, “And also with you. What? Huh? What? Huh? What? When? When?” For those of you that aren’t Catholic, I don’t mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but… There’s a part in church where the priest says, “Peace be with you.” And for many, many years, we all said… – “And also with you.” – Very good. But they changed it to “And with your spirit.” Because that’s what needed revamping in the Catholic Church. That was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. In Rome, they were like, “Let’s see. What problems can we solve? Problem one. No.” I’m actually glad they changed that, though. I never liked “And also with you.” I always found that clunky. “And also with you.” That’s not how you talk. – “Have a nice day.” – “And also you having one.” It’s just a little bit wrong, isn’t it? It’s just a little off. Like, when someone’s like, “How are you?” And you’re like, “Nothing much.” And it sort of makes sense. Never begin a sentence with “And also.” You just immediately sound caught off-guard. It sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren’t expecting it. Like, the priest was like, “Hey, this is the first time we’ve ever had church. I just wanna say, ‘Peace be with you.'” And they were like… “What? Oh. Uh, yeah. And also you should have some.” “Hey, that’s good. Let’s keep that for 2,000 years. And then change it to trick John.”\",\n",
              " 'My wife and I don’t have any children, we have a dog. We have a little puppy named Petunia. She’s a tiny little French bulldog puppy. I like having a puppy that’s a bulldog, ’cause it’s like having a baby that is also a grandma. Her body is young, her face is as old as time. She definitely saw the Nazis march into Paris. She always gives me this look of like, “Oh, the things I have seen, you cocksucker. You have no idea. The Gestapo threw my printing press into a river. But, go, tell your fucking jokes. Bring me my dish.” She said that. Petunia… Petunia is my best friend in the world. I give her a million kisses a day. She does not like me, and barks at me and bites me all day long. We had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because Petunia is a bad dog. We tell her that every day. We go, “Hey, you’re bad at being a dog.” So, the trainer came into the apartment. Sorry, didn’t even walk into the apartment, walked into the threshold and went, “Oh, okay.” Like she was an exorcist or something. She said, “I see what the problem is.” She said, “Petunia has become the alpha of the house.” And then she pointed at me, she said, “You are no longer the alpha of the house.” And in the back of my head, I was like, “I was never the alpha of the house.” I turned to my wife, I was like, “Let’s pretend. It’ll be fun. Yes… My title of alpha, which I once had, how can I reclaim it? Because that was a thing that existed at one time.” She said, “You need to show dominance over your puppy.” These are things people say to me. I said, “How do I do that?” She said, “Well, let me ask you this. Who eats dinner first, you or Petunia?” I was like, “Petunia eats dinner first. She eats dinner at 5:00 p.m., ’cause she’s a foot long and two years old.” She said, “No, you need to eat dinner first. Because the king eats before anyone else eats.” Oh, yes, and what a mighty king I will be, eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon. “Look upon your sovereign, Petunia, and tremble. My lands stretch across this entire one bedroom, and I eat dinner whenever I choose, as long as it works for the schedule of a dog.” She said, “Now, you don’t actually have to eat dinner before Petunia. You just have to convince Petunia that you’ve already eaten.” So… for the past month, I shit you not… before my wife and I give Petunia her dish, we take down empty bowls and spoons, and in front of her, we go, “Mmm, dinner. Mmm, good dinner.” Like we’re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote, but they didn’t work that hard on. “Mmm, we’re eating dinner.” Meanwhile, Petunia’s just staring at us with her Paul Giamatti face, like… “You’re not eating dinner, cocksucker. Dish, now.”',\n",
              " 'I have a wife and a dog, and we just bought a house. We have a new house. It was built in the ’20s, but it was flipped in 2014. Which means it’s haunted, but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash. Actually, we didn’t buy a house. A bank bought a house, and I’m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while I pay it off for 30 years. The woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years. And she said, “So, for instance, this is what you’ll pay in July of 2029.” And I burst out laughing. I was like, “2029? That’s not a real year. By 2029, I’ll be drinking moon juice with President Jonathan Taylor Thomas. I’m not gonna be writing you a paper check.” I like having a house, but I loved looking for a house, ’cause I love real estate agents. I mean, they are the true heroes. They really are. Have you ever watched HGTV? Real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives. Every episode of HGTV is like, “Craig and Stacia are looking for a two-story A-frame that’s near Craig’s job in the downtown, but also satisfies Stacia’s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near Craig’s job. With three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of $7… let’s see what Lori Jo can do on this week’s episode of You Don’t Deserve A Beach House.”',\n",
              " 'I loved our real estate agent. It was so fun to hang out with her. It was like hanging out with my mom. ‘Cause, you know, real estate agents always look like your mom. And they have various Chico’s accoutrements. They always have kind of fun mom energy. And they’re always, “So excited to see you two.” We would have little conferences before we walked into a house. She’d go, “Let’s talk. Let’s talk before we go in.” We’re, like, two feet from the door. “So, there’s no toilets. And I know that was on your list. But I think I can get him to budge. Let’s go.” So, we’d have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent who’s just some guy sitting in a big chair. And these two always hated each other. They’d be like, “Hi, Tony.” “Hi, Kim.” It’s like, “Jesus Christ! What, were you two in the Eagles together? What is the animosity about?” Our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. She hinted about it constantly. Every room she walked into, she’d be like, “So, this could be an office.” “Or maybe a nursery.” “Yeah. No, like we said, we don’t know if we’re gonna have… ” “No, no. I know, I know, you know. You don’t know if you’re gonna have ’em, but you know. You know, you never know. Sometimes you don’t know what’s gonna happen, and then… you know, something happens.” “Well, yeah, that’s how all of life works.” “Okay, all right. Okay. Uh-huh. Mmm. This is an on-fire garbage can. Could be a nursery.” She showed me a backyard once. She goes, “I don’t even like this backyard for you.” I was like, “Oh, do tell.” She said, “It’s all pavement. I think you should have some grass out there. You know, in case you have a couple… little guys… running around in the grass.” And I got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. I was like, “Hey, lady. I went outside about as much as Powder from the movie Powder. My children are not gonna be playing out on grass. They will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. These are my children. And that’s my wife!”',\n",
              " 'I didn’t mean to make it sound like we don’t want children. We don’t, but I didn’t mean to make it sound like that. See, I just don’t think babies like me very much. Sometimes babies will point at me, and I don’t care for that shit at all. Like, I’ll be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one Cheerio with Bobby Fischer-like intensity. And it’ll look up at me and go… I like to lean in and go, “Stop snitchin’, motherfucker.” And then walk off. ‘Cause you’re never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. My friends have babies and I don’t do so well with them. I had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. I know there are better ways to start that story, but… My friend, Jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and I really like her. She’s a sweet kid. I really like his daughter a lot. But I was over at his family’s house for the Fourth of July, and he had his daughter on his knee. And it was a very lovely day. His whole extended family was there. And he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, “Do you know who that is? That’s your Uncle John.” And I was like, “Oh, my God. That’s so sweet. I’m her Uncle John.” And then the baby pointed at me and said, “Uncle John has a penis.” I thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! Fell deadly silent, is what they all did. Hey, do you know what you’re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, “He has a penis”? No, I’m asking, ’cause I don’t know what to say in that situation. Here’s what I went with that day. I said, “Oh, come on!” I don’t know. I thought that’d be good. But then it just made it worse, ’cause it sounded like the baby and I had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. Like, the baby had been like, “Do you have a penis?” And I was like, “Yes, I do, but you’re a baby, so discretion is key.” And then the next day she goes, “He has a penis,” and I go, “Oh, come on! Someone can’t keep a secret!” Luckily, Jeremy’s wife saved the day. The baby’s mom saved the day. She came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, “It’s okay. She’s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot.” Aren’t we all? And, by the way, it would’ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. Like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, “She has a vagina,” the woman could be like, “Yes, I do, and it’s magnificent.” And we would all be like, “Hooray! You are brave!” No one wants to applaud the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo.',\n",
              " 'It’s fun to be married. I’ve never been supervised before. I’m supervised. She studies what I do. Like an anthropologist. She’ll be like, “Sometimes, he will watch a movie on TV even though he already owns that movie on DVD. Pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him.” I had no supervision when I was a kid. We were free to do what we wanted. But also, with that, no one cared about kids. I grew up before children were special. I did. Very early ’80s, right before children became special. Like, I remember when milk carton kids became a thing. When they were like, “Hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. I don’t think they’re just blowing off steam.” No one cared about my opinion when I was a little kid. No one cared what I thought. Sometimes, people would say, “What do you think you’re doing?” But that just meant “Stop.” They didn’t actually wanna know my thought process. They didn’t want me to be like, “Well, I was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when I lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere.” “Oh, well, that’s very interesting. And what brought you to this experiment?” “Oh, well, thank you for asking. Well… you know how I’m filled with rage? I’m so horny and angry all the time… and I have no outlet for it. So… eggs.” Your opinion doesn’t matter in elementary school either. It matters in college. College is just your opinion. Just you raising your hand and being like, “I think Emily Dickinson’s a lesbian.” And they’re like, “Partial credit.” And that’s a whole thing. But in elementary school, it doesn’t matter what you think, it just matters what you know. You have to have answers to questions. And if you say, “I don’t know,” you get an X on your test, and you get it wrong and that’s not fair, ’cause your brain has never been smaller. Also, that’s not how life works. I’m in my 30s now. If you came to me now and you were like, “Hey, John, name three things that the Stamp Act of 1775 accomplished.” I’d go, “I don’t know. Get out of my apartment,” you know? But when you’re a little kid, you can’t say, “I don’t know.” You should be able to. That should be an acceptable answer on a test. You should be able to write in, “I don’t know. I know you told me. But I have had a very long day. I am very small. And I have no money. So you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under.” Or if it’s one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, “Who’s to say?” Kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. Like, that’s the biggest civil rights increase I’ve seen in my lifetime. The rights of children have gone through the roof. I had no rights when I was a little kid. I remember, one time, I walked into a supermarket by myself, and I walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, “No!” And I went, “All right.” And I turned around and left. That’s how broken I was.',\n",
              " 'And there weren’t special things for kids the way there are now. Like, we would just go see movies. Any movie. Like Back to the Future. That was a movie everyone could see. Kids could kinda see it. Great movie, right? I rewatched it recently. It’s a very weird movie. Marty McFly is a 17-year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. And, I shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. They never explain it. Not even in a lazy way, like, “Hey, remember when we met in the science building?” They don’t even do that. And we were all fine with it. We were just like, “What, who’s his best friend? A disgraced nuclear physicist? All right, proceed.” What a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. Two guys had to go in and do that. They had to be like, “Okay… we got an idea… for the next big family-action-comedy. All right, it’s about a guy named Marty, and he’s very lazy. He’s always sleeping late.” “Okay. Is he cool like Ferris Bueller?” “No. But he does have this best friend who’s, you know, a disgraced… nuclear physicist.” “I’m confused here. This best friend, this is another student?” “No, no, no. No, this guy’s either, like, 40 or 80. Even we don’t know how old this guy’s supposed to be. But one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. Whoa!” “Okay. I think I see where you’re going here. They build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the Kennedy assassination.” “Ah! Oh, wow, that’s a really good idea, I mean, we didn’t even think of that.” “All right, well, what do they do with the time machine?” “Well, now I’m embarrassed to say. Ah, well, all right, all right, all right. We thought… We thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom.” “I don’t know. We thought that’d be fun for people. But, no, good point. No, he doesn’t get to, he doesn’t get to. ‘Cause this family friend named Biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. The dad’s gotta beat the rapist off of her. And also, we’re gonna imply that a white man wrote ‘Johnny B. Goode.’ So, we’re gonna take that away from ’em.” “Well, this is the best movie idea I have ever heard in my life. We’re gonna make three of them. Now, you say they go to the past. How about we call it Back to the Past?” “No, no, no. Back to the Future.” “Right, but they go to the past.” “Yeah.”',\n",
              " 'Kids have it very good now. My friend’s a teacher. She told me that, uh… the parents will take the kids’ side over the teacher now. That’s insane. That never happened. My parents trusted every grown-up… more than they trusted me. I don’t mean coaches and teachers. Any human adult’s word… was better than mine. Any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, “Excuse me! Your kid bit my dick.” And my mom would be like, “John Edmund Mulaney, did you bite this nice man’s dick?” And I would be the only one who’s like, “Hey, doesn’t anyone wanna know why… his dick was near my biters… in the first place? Isn’t anyone curious… as to how I had access?” Don’t get me wrong, my parents love us. They just didn’t like us. We weren’t friends. People are now like, “My mom’s my best friend.” I was like, “Oh, is she a super bad mom?” My parents didn’t trust us, and they shouldn’t have trusted us. We were little goblins. We were terrible. I remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. Three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, “All right, we’re going to a resort, and I’ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm.” And we were like, “Oh, yes! Yay! Yes!” “Now, I’m telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm.” “Oh, we’re gonna freak out so bad!” “Yes, John, you have a question?” “How did he lose his arm?” “That’s exactly what you won’t ask.” And then I did ask. I went into the kitchen one day, and I was like, “So, how’d you lose your arm?” And he was like, “Well, I was born with only one arm.” And I was like, “Nah.”',\n",
              " 'No, my parents loved us. It’s just, like, they were the cops, you know? And we were criminals. So, we didn’t get along. We only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. Like, when my dad and I would talk, it was like that scene in the movie Heat, when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino sit down in that diner. We kind of had that rapport of, like, “Hmm, we’re not so different, you and I. You have your law practice, and me, I have all these fucking markers.” “I guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way.” My dad would respect it if I could get away with breaking a rule. We had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch TV on a school night. So, every school night, I would 100% be watching TV. And I would hear my dad coming, I would immediately turn the TV off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. And I’d open it and pretend to be doing homework. My dad would walk in the room and he would go, “What are you doing? Are you watching TV?” And I’d go, “No, man. I’m not watching TV.” And the TV wouldn’t even be dark yet. It would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. It’d be sizzling like a glass of Pepsi. And I would look my dad in the eyes and go, “No, I’m just reading this Yellow Pages.”',\n",
              " \"My dad loved us. He just didn’t care about our general happiness or self-esteem. I remember, one time, we were really little kids. I have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to Wisconsin. My dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. ‘Cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? You remember that era? Where we were like, “How much wood can we get on this car… without it catching on fire?” But then the big announcement. “We here at Plymouth-Chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times you’ve looked at your minivan and thought, ‘Huh! It needs a belt.'” So, we’re going on the highway. We’ve been on the road for three hours. And in the distance, we see a McDonald’s. We see the golden arches. And we got so excited. We started chanting, “McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s!” And my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. And then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. And kept driving. And, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. How perfect is that? He had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. The one thing from McDonald’s no child could enjoy. My dad is cold-blooded. He once shushed a kid during Lion King on Broadway. That actually happened. We were at Lion King on Broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, “Look, it’s Pumbaa! Look, it’s Timon!” And my dad turned around and said, “Are you going to talk the entire time?” He’s my hero.\",\n",
              " 'The weirdest thing when I was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. They scared us about it constantly. And I’ve been on tour this year… Marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another. It’s insane. Yeah, well… All right, don’t “whoo” if you’re white. It’s always been legal for us. Come on, sir. We don’t go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy. When I was arrested with a one-hitter at a Rusted Root concert, I did not serve hard time. I think I got an award. Eighteen or 19 states. And, by the way, I agree, it’s a very good thing. But it’s also a really weird thing, because this is the first time I’ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like, “Fine.” You know? I’ve never seen it before. Like, gay marriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the Supreme Court, and be like, “Gay people are humans.” And they’re like, “We’ll think about it.” But with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for 40 years, like, “Excuse me.” And then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and they’re just like, “Okay, here. Take a little. We’d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else… blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.” Those stupid parents. And that’s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. It would be on our sitcoms. We’d be watching Saved by the Bell, we’d be having a great old time. And then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. And they’d always hold the joint… The bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. They’d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. Like it’s a skull in a Shakespeare play. And now it’s legal, and that is great news. Unless you’re a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. And I don’t just mean because they’re about to lose out to Amazon.com. I more feel bad for weed dealers ’cause they’re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. And we don’t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. Like, when the Chinese food delivery guy comes, we don’t let him hang out after he’s delivered the Chinese food. And we don’t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we’re hanging out with… to try to preserve the relationship. And we definitely don’t give him some of the Chinese food. He’s never like, “Hey, can I get in on those dumplings?” And we’re like, “Yeah, we’re all friends.”',\n",

They’re a group of French assholes that are slowly taking over America by humiliating audience members one by one. We once went to see Cirque du Soleil at Navy Pier when I was a kid, and my brother came, and he was 12 years old.

I was there for a couple weeks. I was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. This woman named Mischa sat in the other cubicle. I want to get the number right. I think Mischa had… about 900,000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. Almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, A Beautiful Mind-style. I think about Mischa two times a week… because of a phone call she had next to me one day. It was one of my first days, and I was sitting next to her. And her phone rang, and this was her call, and I’m quoting. Her phone rang and she said, “Hello? Hush!” And then she hung up. Think about that two times a week. And I didn’t know her well enough by then to be like, “Hey, what kind of a person are you?” You know? Who could she have been talking to? “Hello? Hush!” This was a place of business.

              " \"I temped at a little web company on 25th Street in New York City. It was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money New York. His name was Henry J. Finch IV. Like old, old, old money. Like, his money was in molasses or something. He owned this web company. I have no idea why he owned this web company. I think he won it in a rich man’s game of dice and small binoculars, or something. Mr. Finch wore linen suits. He had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. I’m giving you more description than you need, ’cause I need you to believe me. This was a real person I knew in the 21st century. Mr. Finch was in his 70s. He had an assistant named Mary. She was in her 50s, she was Korean. I don’t know why he had an assistant. He did not need one. Unless he needed someone to be like, “Remember, Mr. Finch, at five o’clock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled egg.” One day, Mr. Finch came into the office. It had been raining. Everything I’m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. Mr. Finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. And he walked in and he said, and I’m quoting, “Ah! One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” And then Mary yelled, “Ooh, ducklings!” To which Mr. Finch replied, “Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack.” And then walked into his office. I think about that every goddamn day. I mean, imagine you’re me. You’re a 22-year-old temp, and you’re so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. And then that happens in front of you, and I don’t know, gives you hope? And I did that a little fast. Let me break that conversation down for you. Mr. Finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. “Ah!” “One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!” The rain. “And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” Now, that’s debatable. But rather than debate that point, Mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point… which was, “Ducklings!” But Mr. Finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality… said, “Ah, too old to be a duckling!” As if to say, “My duckling days are behind me. Mary, don’t you see? I’m a duck now. And to prove it… Well, I’ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has… ‘Quack, quack.'” And I knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to Mr. Finch, what he had said. Crazy people are like that. They have unlimited crazy currency. Like, if I had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, “Hey, Finch, you remember that time you were like, ‘Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack’?” He would just be like, “Ah, perhaps I did quack! But such is life for an old knickerbocker like me.” Like, he’d say something else crazy.\",\n",
              " 'That’s the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? Is that they just have unlimited currency. The things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. I was once walking into Penn Station in New York. I was walking down 31st Street towards Eighth Avenue. I’m walking down 31st, there’s this woman standing at Eighth and 31st. I have my little roller suitcase. You can all imagine. I’m walking towards her. She’s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. She’s watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had Terminator vision… where she could see little bits of data, like, “Little honky ass,” and could read information. As I walked past her, she said this to me. I walked past her and she said, and I’m quoting, “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” Very dirty, yes? A very upsetting thing to hear, yes? I’m sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. I was alone out there that afternoon. And she said this totally unprompted. “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” It wasn’t like I had paused in front of her and been like, “What should I do with my life?” So, I walk away from her with this to-do list. And I like structure, I like a to-do list. It did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. ‘Cause it starts in a pretty rough place. It starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. But by the end, you have your own small business. And isn’t that the American dream when all’s said and done? That if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. Imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, “But I…” This has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. I just wanna say that in all sincerity. Thanks for coming to this. Really, really appreciate it.',\n",
              " 'I wanna tell you one more story before I get out of here, about the night I met a guy named Bill Clinton. Now, I don’t… Some of you know who that is? For those of you that don’t, he was President of the United States from 1993 until 2001, and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared Emperor of the United States of America. Now, I know you know who Bill Clinton is. But I was doing a show at a college, and I mentioned Bill Clinton, and, like, they kind of didn’t know who he was. Like, sorry, they knew the name, right? But they only knew this 2015 Bill Clinton, who’s a very different Bill Clinton. Have you seen his ass lately? What the hell is he trying to pull? He’s all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and he’s got these grandpa reading glasses, like, “Hey, I can’t do nothing to nobody no more.” “Oh, me? I’m just an old, old man. I don’t have the appetites.” You know? And he’s always flying around the world with Bill Gates trying to cure AIDS.',\n",
              " 'That is not the Bill Clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago. Our Bill Clinton was like a big, fat Buddy Garrity from Friday Night Lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on Arsenio, and his work in the STD community was not in curing anything at that time. That was the man we all elected president. That was the Bill Clinton that I met. I got to meet Bill Clinton when he was Governor Clinton in 1992, when he was first running for president.',\n",
              " 'And I got to meet Bill Clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as Bill Clinton. They’re a little younger, but they went to the same college. So, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. Now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. One, I got to meet Bill Clinton. But two, I got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. And that is super funny to see, ’cause think about some of the people you went to school with. Now imagine they’re becoming the president. Imagine Sam was becoming the president. It would stir up strong emotions. And my parents had very different opinions on Bill Clinton.',\n",
              " 'My mom loved Bill Clinton, ’cause Bill Clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. I mean, think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like Frank Caliendo doing John Madden. Now… imagine him as a college student. And my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. That sounds good, right? So, my mom tells me that Bill Clinton would be out in front of the library every single night… just being like, “Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home?” And one night, my mom was leaving the library, and Bill Clinton was like, “Hey, can I walk ya home?” And my mom was like, “Hell, yes.” So… This is absolutely true. My mom, little Ellen Stanton, walked arm-in-arm with Bill Clinton to her dorm. And she was like, “You know, I wanted to invite him up for a beer.” And I was like, “Thanks, I’m nine.” But… her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with Bill Clinton.',\n",
              " 'Now, my dad, on the other hand, hated Bill Clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. And also, my dad’s a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. He always told me that he hated it in college that Bill Clinton could, quote, “Get away with anything.” Can you imagine how he felt later?',\n",
              " 'So, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet Bill Clinton. My mom opens it first and she goes, “Oh, we have to go. We have to go see Bill.” And without looking up at her, my dad just says, “Why? It’s not like he’s gonna remember you.” One black coffee. Same motherfucker. So, my mom says, “Fine! I’ll go and I’ll take John.” And I was like, “Hell, yeah.” And I slid in the room in my First Communion suit, ready to go. ‘Cause I loved Bill Clinton. I was ten years old. If you were a kid when Bill Clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. We’d never seen a cool politician before. And he would go on MTV, and he’d have cool answers to kids’ questions. They’d be like, “Governor, what’s your favorite food?” And he’d be like, “I don’t know, fries?” And we’d be like, “Yay, we eat fries!”',\n",
              " 'I learned to play his campaign song on the piano. It was “Don’t Stop” by Fleetwood Mac… from Rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. He let us know who he was right away. So, I went with my mom, as her date… to reconnect with Governor Bill Clinton. We walked into the ballroom. It was a big hotel ballroom. It was the Palmer House Hilton, big Hilton hotel ballroom. Walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. It’s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie The Fugitive, remember? So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people, the… Sorry, the end where Harrison Ford, as Dr. Richard Kimble, bursts in to confront Dr. Charles Nichols, right? Okay. So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people. Why does Kimble confront Nichols? Well, I know we all know this, but… No, no. But, but, but… Kimble, he found out that Nichols, along with Devlin MacGregor and Lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired Frederick Sykes, the one-armed man, to kill Kimble. Kimble’s wife wasn’t even the target. I know we all know this. But they were gonna kill Kimble because he wasn’t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass RUD-90. So, Kimble finds out about all of this, and, of course, he’s furious. And he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, “You switched the samples!” And Dr. Nichols is like, “Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, Dr. Richard Kimble.” What accent did that guy have, by the way? He goes, “You switched the samples! And you doctored your research! So that you could have Provasic!”',\n",
              " 'Anyway, so it’s that ballroom. So, we walk into that ballroom. It was packed with people. It was packed with people. A real Who’s Not of Chicago celebrities. Walter Jacobson was there. Walter Jacobson was the local Fox anchor. He’d do fun things where he’d go undercover as a homeless person. And he’d be like, “Oh, what time is the soup?” And they’d be like, “Man, you’re Walter Jacobson.” He was there. Everybody. And on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we saw a little bit of silver hair. And it was him… Bill Clinton. The Comeback Kid. But he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and Secret Service. So, what are you gonna do? Well, if you’re my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. And then you start jogging while yelling, “This ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the United States!” Kind of implying that I might be dying. My feet were not on the ground. She was swinging me like a snowplow. I was just mowing down fat Chicago Democrats. I pushed past all the reporters, I pushed past all the photographers. We pushed past all the Secret Service.',\n",

She goes, “Hi, Bill.” Then it is revealed that she has no plan. So… she pushes me towards Clinton and she goes, “This is my son, John, and he’s also going to be president.” And I was like, “What the hell are you talking about? I’m not gonna be president.” And I know now that I’m definitely never gonna be president. Not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. Based on my ten-year-old memory, Bill Clinton is about 13 feet tall. And he leaned down, because, well, I was wearing this button that I bought outside the fundraiser. It was a cartoon button of George H. W. Bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. And it said, “Bird-brained.” And I thought it was very funny. And Bill Clinton leaned down so that only I could hear and he said, “Hey, man, I like your button.” And I said, “You can do whatever you want forever.” And he took my advice.

That morning, I wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. I am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach.

Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, \\u2019cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very exciting day for me. It\\u2019s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought\\u2026 is \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cFuck you. I don\\u2019t even know you, but fuck you!\\u201d \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m straight up jealous. I\\u2019m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. And then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don\\u2019t have insomnia yet. They don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don\\u2019t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It\\u2019s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don\\u2019t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It\\u2019s coming. You don\\u2019t have HPV yet, you\\u2019re a fucking loser, all right? That\\u2019s what that says about you. A lot of men don\\u2019t know that they have HPV, because it\\u2019s undetectable in men. It\\u2019s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says, \\u201cBoo!\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We\\u2019ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I\\u2019m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I\\u2019m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that\\u2019s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That\\u2019s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I\\u2019m a horrible person, I\\u2019m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82\\u2026 manual. The manual. She don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, \\u201cYou never know when you might need this.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cBut\\u2026 I do know\\u2026 that I\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.\\u201d I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I\\u2019m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They\\u2019re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me, he\\u2019s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, who is that?\\u201d And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m gonna trap his ass.\\u201d \\u201cGoing to trap his ass!\\u201d And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, \\u201cAll right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.\\u201d When, really, it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to\\u2026 It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had\\u2026 We had so much chemistry. He was like, \\u201cHey, wassup?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWassup?\\u201d And we\\u2013 The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, \\u201cHey, can you drop me off?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He was like, \\u201cAt the park.\\u201d And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, \\u201cOh, no!\\u201d \\u201cI just fucked a homeless dude! Again!\\u201d My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It\\u2019s\\u2026 too much. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 You feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you\\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very, you know, it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know, just right there, through the money hole and just\\u2026 And then also, he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there. I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cI could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!\\u201d You know? But I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don\\u2019t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing. It\\u2019s what love is built on, you know? My last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, \\u201cHold it. You guys aren\\u2019t Mexican?\\u201d Asian-American men are very underrated. I don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them. They\\u2019re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It\\u2019s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI did not ask to be exfoliated today.\\u201d \\u201cThis is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.\\u201d And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from. I think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he\\u2019s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we\\u2019re both half-fancy Asian\\u2026 \\u2026and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn\\u2019t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!\\u201d I was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not authentic, OK?\\u201d You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That\\u2019s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it\\u2019s funny, right, because he\\u2019s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I\\u2013 I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition. That\\u2019s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head. First passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, \\u201cShut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?\\u201d And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, \\u201cOh, my God! He proposed!\\u201d \\u201cIt came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something\\u2026 that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.\\u201d Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday\\u2026 because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That\\u2019s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I\\u2019m a completely different person. You\\u2013 Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I\\u2019m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We\\u2019ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me. \\u2018Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t. I straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she\\u2019s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don\\u2019t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re dumb women. We don\\u2019t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018Cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility.\\u201d And then, all these women had to show off and be like, \\u201cWe could do it! We could do anything.\\u201d \\u201cBitch, shut up!\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell them the secret.\\u201d They ruined it for us, and now we\\u2019re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, \\u201cDouble-income household,\\u201d I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cBut, Ali, we have so many more options now.\\u201d Oh, you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? A lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street. And they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cLook at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat bitch is a genius.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a housewife, she\\u2019s retired.\\u201d I do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day, every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don\\u2019t gotta do that. They don\\u2019t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your co-worker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, no! Courtney\\u2019s listening. She\\u2019s waiting. She\\u2019s timing me.\\u201d And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don\\u2019t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don\\u2019t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want. You know, it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, \\u201cYou need to get to work on time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYou need to eat bananas.\\u201d \\u201cI saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.\\u201d My father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, \\u201cHey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhy you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don\\u2019t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, \\u2018I do,\\u2019 what I really meant was, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m done.'\\u201d I\\u2019m done. I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore and I\\u2019m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I\\u2019ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That\\u2019s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just\\u2026 Let\\u2019s redecorate. I gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I\\u2019m a\\u2013 I\\u2019m a disgusting pervert. I\\u2019m a pervert. I\\u2019m a gross filthy animal. And I think it\\u2019s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\\u2026 y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it\\u2019s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you. I broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, \\u201cUh, you\\u2019re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist\\u2026 and posted \\u2018Tiny Asian female seeking anal\\u2026\\u2019 the Internet would crash.\\u201d \\u201cAnd all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.\\u201d They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know\\u2026 freaked out about anal. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t wanna do that. I\\u2019m scared of\\u2013 of the pain.\\u201d You ain\\u2019t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You\\u2019re not scared of the pain. What you\\u2019re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You\\u2019re scared that he\\u2019s gonna see that and that\\u2019s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can\\u2019t help you now. But don\\u2019t worry, \\u2019cause when he puts it in the butt, all he\\u2019s thinking about is, \\u201cI just put it in her butt.\\u201d \\u201cI gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.\\u201d You\\u2019re\\u2013 If you\\u2019re married, you\\u2019re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don\\u2019t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you\\u2019ll feel like you\\u2019re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I\\u2019m a little bit\\u2026 \\u2026stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, \\u201cOh, my God! It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m going back in time!\\u201d \\u266a A whole new world \\u266a It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to\\u2026 Now, if you haven\\u2019t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your\\u2013 Just give your man a little\\u2013 a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you\\u2019ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You\\u2019ll get a lot of \\u201cNo! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 No! I don\\u2019t! I don\\u2019t! No!\\u201d They get all squirmy wormy because\\u2026 they\\u2019re scared. They\\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they\\u2019re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man\\u2019s eye like he\\u2019s discovered nirvana. And it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When\\u2013 When I\\u2019ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. \\u201cHey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?\\u201d I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cYes, I know you respect me and that\\u2019s why you need to abuse me. OK?\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their\\u2013 Glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 It\\u2019s because we\\u2019re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t wanna die! Don\\u2019t kill me! I don\\u2019t wanna die!\\u201d But I also don\\u2019t want to be sure that I\\u2019m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just\\u2013 Just choke me enough so that I can\\u2019t talk. \\u2018Cause if I can talk, I\\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. And I\\u2019m tired of being the boss. I\\u2019m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I\\u2019m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools, because according to her, it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy,\\u201d because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re bossy,\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say, \\u201cYou have executive leadership skills.\\u201d Which is a very roundabout way of saying: \\u201cYou\\u2019re a little cunt.\\u201d I\\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I\\u2019m talking about? I\\u2019m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That\\u2019s the kind of income bracket I\\u2019m striving for. That\\u2019s when you know you\\u2019ve made it, when you\\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango\\u2026 \\u2026Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don\\u2019t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It\\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics\\u2026 don\\u2019t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There\\u2019s\\u2013 None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That\\u2019s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cGuys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit. It\\u2019s so annoying and boring.\\u201d And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s hilarious. I identify.\\u201d And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper \\u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\\u2019s head shredding it up. She\\u2019s busy. So, I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, \\u201cAli, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become\\u2013 You\\u2019re gonna disappear, and you\\u2019re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s the dream.\\u201d That\\u2019s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know? Another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, \\u201cWhy are you gonna have a kid? Why don\\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s cool\\u2026 until my husband dies.\\u201d Which he\\u2019s definitely gonna before me. Because I\\u2019m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I\\u2019m a billion. I\\u2019m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack.\\u201d Well, Asian don\\u2019t die. We don\\u2019t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers? Because we\\u2019re trying to die. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!\\u201d \\u201cImma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna make a right turn\\u2013 I changed my mind, it\\u2019s a U-turn!\\u201d \\u201cI changed my mind again. It\\u2019s a O-turn!\\u201d Every time I get into a car accident\\u2026 \\u2026I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, my God, not again!\\u201d I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me, but I\\u2019m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It\\u2019s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. \\u2018Cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I\\u2019m just kidding. She doesn\\u2019t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I\\u2019m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore. I\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That\\u2019s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don\\u2019t give a fuck. They got no shame. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park, do this shit.\\u201d They do that \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a free activity. For them. They do it in their\\u2013 their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh, I\\u2019m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it\\u2013 And it scared me. Like, I\\u2019m only 33 and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It\\u2019s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just\\u2026 \\u201cI slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what kind of mother I\\u2019m gonna be. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. \\u201cUh, mmm.\\u201d They watch Property Brothers, scratch, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019? Mmm.\\u201d Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, \\u201cWhen can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers?\\u201d Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood. If it\\u2019s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, \\u201cOh, my God, that\\u2019s so hot. You guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019?\\u201d No, dude. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in\\u2013 When you\\u2019re in your 30s, and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019. It tells you when it\\u2019s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Release the Kraken!'\\u201d And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um\\u2026 yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex, \\u2019cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOK, it\\u2019s go time,\\u201d and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says, \\u201cPlease, hurry the fuck up.\\u201d And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupid-ass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just\\u2026 And then, because we\\u2019re hippies, I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cHey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?\\u201d And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That\\u2019s right. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, my God. That\\u2019s so dark and terrible. I can\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d I\\u2019m 33. Girl, when you\\u2019re 33, you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It\\u2019s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom\\u2013 She\\u2019s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, \\u201cUh, yeah. Where I\\u2019m from, that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes. It\\u2019s whatevs, OK?\\u201d And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, \\u201cOh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you\\u2019re having twins.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo!\\u201d And then she said, \\u201cBut what I don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d \\u201cThe Lord is mysterious!\\u201d Don\\u2019t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, \\u201cYou look.\\u201d \\u201cYou watch the whole thing.\\u201d And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyonc\\u00e9. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That\\u2019s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth, though. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m very, very scared of childbirth. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser S\\u00f6ze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, \\u201cAli, did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\\u201d I\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can\\u2019t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That\\u2019s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. \\u201cHey, can you wash the dishes?\\u201d \\u201cNo!\\u201d \\u201cCan you water the plants?\\u201d \\u201cI am not doing jack shit anymore. I\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball, OK? Are you makin\\u2019 a foot? I didn\\u2019t think so. You change the channel.\\u201d I can already see how there\\u2019s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me. \\u201cOh, my God. I can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments. He is so supportive.\\u201d Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I\\u2019m the star of the show. There\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if I\\u2019m not there. But he\\u2019s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I\\u2019m a bad mommy. You know, I\\u2013 I\\u2013 I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I\\u2019m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn\\u2019t know that. I didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big\\u2013 they get big, like fingers. Like, \\u201cYou, you. You owe me money, you.\\u201d My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy\\u2019s all wet again. But it\\u2019s different. It\\u2019s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, \\u201cWhy is it different?\\u201d And I looked it up, and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That\\u2019s not the same. When it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue, when it\\u2019s Neosporin. So, you know, I\\u2013 I, in\\u2013 previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who\\u2019s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he\\u2019s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron\\u2019d my ass. And now, if I don\\u2019t work, we die. Why else do you think I\\u2019m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I\\u2019ve been Ali Wong.

Thank you, San Francisco. Thank you so much. So good to be here. People were surprised when I told \\u2019em I was gonna tape my special in San Francisco. Said, \\u201cWhy would you do that? That\\u2019s the most politically correct city in the world.\\u201d Not when I\\u2019m on stage, it\\u2019s not. I love this place. One of my favorite cities to perform in. It\\u2019s a good place to hang out. Got to walk around a little bit today. Saw a baby. Saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. So it\\u2019s been a great day. Love that. Don\\u2019t get me wrong. I\\u2019m not a monster. I tried to help the baby. Tried to throw a rock through the window. Window was down. Ruined that baby\\u2019s whole weekend. It was worth it. I love San Francisco. One of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. Yeah. Women in San Francisco are gorgeous. I say that despite what\\u2019s\\u2026 going on in this crowd tonight. But you guys live here. You guys live here. You\\u2019ve seen \\u2019em. I was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. Like a supermodel. I walked up, I was like, \\u201cHey, where you from? What do you do?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cOh, me? I live here in San Francisco. I\\u2019m a brain surgeon.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if this makes me sexist, but I was really impressed. You know? I mean\\u2026 Most women\\u2026 can\\u2019t pull off sarcasm. This is gonna be a good show. See, that joke, that joke is a test. To see if you guys are cool or not. That thing about the baby in the car, that\\u2019s just me clearing my throat. That joke\\u2019s the test. If you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. You don\\u2019t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. And I\\u2019ve had shows go very, very bad. Doesn\\u2019t matter to me at all. Now, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. I, uh\\u2026 I used to have a son. Already some of you see where this is going, that\\u2019s good. That\\u2019s good. I used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. The same way Eric Clapton\\u2019s son died. For inspiration. I\\u2019m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. You guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. Then started clapping, that is amazing. Most people just boo me. But if you didn\\u2019t understand the joke\\u2026 don\\u2019t worry. It\\u2019s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. That joke is like an onion. You\\u2019ve gotta know who Eric Clapton is. Not a given these days. You\\u2019ve gotta know about his kid. You gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. You gotta know about that terrible fucking song. And then you gotta think all that\\u2019s funny. Now, I gotta get to know you guys a little bit. Starting with you for sure. I can tell you\\u2019re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. Did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? What is your name? \\u2013 Peggy Jo. \\u2013 Peggy. Peggy, what do you try to do? Not a lot, I\\u2019m disabled. You\\u2019re disabled? I know you\\u2019re disabled. Is this your husband with you? Okay. Sir, what do you do, so I can move the fuck on. \\u2013 I\\u2019m an electrician. \\u2013 You\\u2019re an electrician? Great. That\\u2019s an honorable job. That\\u2019s a good job to have. I\\u2019m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. Electrician. It\\u2019s a wonderful job. There\\u2019s a lot of bad jobs out there, I\\u2019ll tell you that right now. Lot of bad jobs. Hell, my Uncle John runs a summer camp for\\u2026 kids about to get molested. I know, right? I know, it sounds awful. Sounds awful, but he loves it. He\\u2019s like\\u2026 Says he\\u2019s never worked a day in his life. Doesn\\u2019t pay much, but the benefits\\u2026 Do you guys have any kids? How many? I have one, and he has two. Okay. You guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offenders live around you? Isn\\u2019t it crazy? Isn\\u2019t it way more than you\\u2019d think? You think it might be like one or two. No, it\\u2019s like chicken pox. I went online, 15 child molesters. Fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. So, why do we always have to meet at my place? And if you\\u2019re wondering, \\u201cAnthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know, probably. Seems like something I would do. I of course live in Los Angeles. I\\u2019ve got a nice place. Obviously. My brother\\u2019s been staying with me, which has been awful. My brother is crazy. Even my neighbors hate him. The other day I opened the door, I caught him masturbating. He looks me right in the eyes and goes, \\u201cShut the door.\\u201d I said, \\u201cGet inside.\\u201d My family loves it when I put them in jokes. They love it. \\u201cAnthony, please, put me in your next joke.\\u201d \\u201cAre you sure? I\\u2019m gonna make you a pedophile.\\u201d \\u201cWe don\\u2019t care. We wanna be part of this thing you\\u2019ve got going on.\\u201d So I wrote that joke, put my brother in. I\\u2019m in Chicago, where he lives. After the show, he comes backstage and I say, \\u201cMikey, what\\u2019d you think about that new joke? Did you like the shout out?\\u201d And he gets all uncomfortable. He goes, \\u201cWell, crowd seemed to think it was funny\\u2026 but I think it\\u2019s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cWhat, Mikey? No! No, Mikey. You\\u2019re my brother. That\\u2019s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cYeah, and then you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Get back inside.'\\u201d Just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother\\u2019s a fuckin\\u2019 idiot. Yeah, I\\u2019ve got a nice place. Try to keep it nice. Not always successful. Like, I tried getting a puppy. Disaster. Had to get rid of that puppy. Had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. The first time I left it home alone, the first time I left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. Why are you mad? I\\u2019m the one who couldn\\u2019t get his money back. And this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. After I kill a puppy with neglect. And it\\u2019s okay. It\\u2019s okay, you can get mad at me. You can hate me. You can hate me and still laugh at me. That\\u2019s how talented I am. And I\\u2019m used to it. I\\u2019m used to it. I once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. Once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. I didn\\u2019t do anything about it. I didn\\u2019t say anything about it. I just turned around and left the room. But in my head, in my head, all I was thinking was\\u2026 \\u201cNow we\\u2019re even.\\u201d She was so mad. She got mad at me. She got mad at me \\u2019cause I killed all of her plants. Killed every single one of her house plants. And she had told me. She said, \\u201cAnthony, I\\u2019m going out of town for two weeks. Give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.\\u201d But I\\u2019m a dude. All I heard was \\u201ctwo weeks\\u201d and \\u201ccheat on me.\\u201d Like my neighbors in L.A\\u2026 My neighbors in L.A. have got this smokin\\u2019 hot 18-year-old daughter. I mean, she\\u2019s perfect. But she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. Which is horrible. Doesn\\u2019t she understand how dumb that\\u2019s gonna look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? Yeah, that\\u2019s a joke. That\\u2019s a joke where I\\u2019m a serial killer. I\\u2019m very open about it. Don\\u2019t you dare tighten up on me. I hate sensitivity. I hate it. Even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. I got a six-year-old nephew. I asked what he wants for his birthday. He said, \\u201cUncle Anthony, I want you to get me a Barbie doll.\\u201d I said, \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cYou six-year-old piece of shit.\\u201d And don\\u2019t get me wrong. Don\\u2019t get me wrong, I don\\u2019t care if he plays with dolls. He can wear dresses if he wants to. But I\\u2019m not getting him a Barbie doll. You see, Barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations\\u2026 \\u2026of how easy it\\u2019s gonna be to tear off a head. I won\\u2019t do it. I get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. If you\\u2019re sensitive about comedy, it\\u2019s the dumbest thing you can do. I call them the joke police. They always have one rule, one rule they have. You can\\u2019t make fun of this right now. After a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it\\u2019s so hypocritical. Like the thing today, the thing right now you can\\u2019t make fun of, the thing that\\u2019s too sensitive at this moment? Trans-gendered people. See? You can\\u2019t do it. Can\\u2019t make fun of them. It\\u2019s too sensitive. In fact, you can\\u2019t even call them \\u201cchicks with dicks\\u201d anymore. No. No. You have to call them \\u201cmen who talk too much.\\u201d Right? But I hear this all the time. People\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cAnthony, that was really funny. But, man, women must hate you. Women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.\\u201d And I always say, \\u201cNo. No. Stupid women hate my shows.\\u201d \\u201cStupid women hate my shows. Smart women\\u2026 don\\u2019t come to my shows.\\u201d Speaking of which, what\\u2019s your name? \\u2013 What? Kim. \\u2013 Kim. \\u2013 Kim, where you from? \\u2013 San Jose. San Jose? Okay. What do you do, Kim? Um, I\\u2019m a branch manager. \\u2013 Like for a bank? For a Pizza Hut? \\u2013 No, for\\u2026 What? What the fuck? Where\\u2019d you go to school? \\u2013 UC Santa Cruz. \\u2013 What\\u2019d you study? \\u2013 Economics. \\u2013 Economics? Okay. You ever gonna use that someday? I had to go to Catholic school when I was a kid. Hated Catholic school. Hated Catholic school more than anything. The nuns were vicious. They would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. Anything to defend themselves. You guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? Hated school. When I was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. Came down with the cancer. Which was sad. But the story is actually cool and inspiring. Every single guy\\u2026 Every single guy in the school, we all\\u2026 shaved our heads to make fun of him. Yeah. No, it was great. It was great, we did it for like a month. We would have kept doin\\u2019 it, but you know. You know how cancer gets. You guys ever\\u2026 You guys ever trace back your family history? Go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn\\u2019t know? I traced my family tree back, found that I actually had family fighting on both sides in World War II. Humiliating. The piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the Nazi infantry in Germany, while the bad-ass Jeselniks were here in America spying for the Germans. I assume everyone is drinking tonight? \\u2013 Yeah! \\u2013 Yeah! Whoo! That\\u2019s good. I love to drink. Love it. Do it all the time, every day, always have. I don\\u2019t know where it comes from either. Even my parents tell me, when I was just a little baby, I used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet\\u2026 to try to spend time with them. I like San Francisco, so liberal. So liberal. Clap your hands here. Clap your hands if you own a gun. San Jose is in the house, huh? Not too bad. I once asked the crowd in Houston that question. They just started firing guns in the air. Didn\\u2019t even let me finish the question. I don\\u2019t own a gun. I\\u2019m against guns, to be honest. When I was a kid\\u2026 When I was a kid, my parents had a gun. My parents said we had to have a gun. Gotta have a gun to protect the five children. Gotta have a gun to protect our five children. Of course, they eventually got rid of it\\u2026 to protect their four children. I\\u2019m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. I was getting pretty good towards the end. Man, my parents were strict. Mom and dad were strict. My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. I learned a lot from my parents. Especially my dad. Like, I\\u2019ll never forget\\u2026 the first time I ever got a bad report card in school. First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. Beat the hell out of me. But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom. Let her take the hit. Yeah.\\nMy dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don\\u2019t take classes. You don\\u2019t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out. Like, when I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR.\\nAs a kid, my dad\\u2019s prized possession, my dad\\u2019s favorite thing in the world growing up? My dad was the proud owner of a Mickey Mantle rookie card. Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. Kept it between two little pieces of plastic. But I was a kid. I didn\\u2019t know any better. One day I took that card to school and I traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. You know what that card is worth today? My relationship with my father.\\nI mean it, my dad was no joke. My dad did not fuck around. My dad did not trust anybody. My dad did not trust anyone. In fact, he had a saying\\u2026 but he wouldn\\u2019t tell me. What, too clever for you? That joke is fuckin\\u2019 amazing. Last year was a sad year for my family. Last year, my mom should\\u2019ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. But because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. It was sad.\\nWhen I was a kid, I used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. When I was a kid, we were poor. So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. Of course this was before 9/11 so\\u2026 my bad, everybody. Weird joke to clap for, but sure. My mom actually should\\u2019ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.\\nI mean, don\\u2019t get me wrong, I loved my mother. She was my mom, of course I loved her. We fought a lot. My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That\\u2019s ignorance and I hate that. When I was a kid, like nine years old, I\\u2019d come home after school. Once in a while, I\\u2019d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. Once in a while, I\\u2019d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She\\u2019d pull me aside and say, \\u201cAnthony, who\\u2019s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?\\u201d And I would say, \\u201cShut up, Mom, that\\u2019s racist. Put your money away.\\u201d I never get to see my family anymore, really. Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. \\u2018Cause they\\u2019re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony. You. \\u2013 What\\u2019s your name? \\u2013 Melissa. \\u2013 Melissa, where you from? \\u2013 Santa Clara. \\u2013 What do you do? \\u2013 I win things on the radio. \\u2013 You win things on the radio? \\u2013 Yeah. Follow-up question, how\\u2019d you get tickets to this? Let me ask you this. You ever, uh\\u2026 you ever find a body in the woods? Ever do that? No? It\\u2019s okay. I have. I was walking through the woods one day and\\u2026 some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something. I never told anybody about it. But I went back there a week later, and he was dead. Yeah. I do crazy shit like that all the time. What can I say? I\\u2019m wacky. The other night I was driving my car. I was driving my car and I ran over a deer\\u2026 a dear, dear friend. I\\u2019m torn constantly. At night, I do shows, but during the day, I\\u2019ve got a hobby. During the day, I go from town to town\\u2026 and I shut down the local abortion clinic. You heard me. I shut down abortion clinics everywhere I go. It\\u2019s easy for me. I\\u2019m charming. I stand outside the front doors all day long and\\u2026 consistently underbid them. You guys mad about that one? It\\u2019s gonna get so much fuckin\\u2019 worse. Gotta talk to one more person. You, sir. What\\u2019s your name? \\u2013 Allan. \\u2013 Allan, where you from? \\u2013 Frisco. \\u2013 Frisco. I can tell you\\u2019re a local \\u2019cause of how cool you are. What do you do, Frisco? \\u2013 I fight fires. I fight fires. \\u2013 You what? You\\u2019re a firefighter? Awesome. What do you wanna do? If you could do anything. If you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? \\u2013 Travel the world. \\u2013 Travel the world. It\\u2019s good to have a dream. I hope you go for it. It doesn\\u2019t sound like you\\u2019re even gonna get close. I think you should do it. Travel the world. Do it.\\nEveryone should try to live their dream, that\\u2019s my point. Everyone. I get to live my dream. I mean, not when I\\u2019m in San Francisco, but for the most part. Being a comedian was my dream. \\u2018Cause no one can tell me what to do. That\\u2019s all I cared about. Most people don\\u2019t ever try to live their dream. Lot of people try and they fail. Which I think is better, more noble, more respectable.\\nI had an uncle. All he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about\\u2026 wanted to become an astronaut. Fly into space one day. And he went for it. He went for it. And he failed. He blew it. Ended up becoming one of those pussies\\u2026 \\u2026on the Space Shuttle Challenger. You guys remember that, right? I think it\\u2019s funny. I think it\\u2019s funny how the things that happen to us when we\\u2019re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. I got this little niece. When she was three years old, she almost drowned. And now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. Yeah, I was babysitting her\\u2026 and trying to do laundry. And she accidentally fell into the washing machine. Thought I was quick. I got good reflexes. I thought I got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. Turned everything pink. You\\u2019re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. Hey, did you guys know\\u2026 Did you guys know that when a newborn baby\\u2026 when a newborn baby is first born, when it\\u2019s fresh out of the womb\\u2026 it can actually hear and see everything around it\\u2026 for up to ten seconds after it\\u2019s decapitated? Yeah. Yeah. I never know what to say. I never know what to say to someone after they\\u2019ve lost a baby. What do you say to someone after they\\u2019ve lost a baby? \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m sorry for your loss\\u201d? Doesn\\u2019t cut it. \\u201cAre you gonna be okay?\\u201d Not even close. That\\u2019s why I just keep my mouth shut. Let my lawyer do the talking. I\\u2019m not good with kids. That\\u2019s my point. That\\u2019s what this whole thing\\u2019s about. I\\u2019m not good with kids. Not gonna lie. Hell, a couple of months ago, I dropped my cousin\\u2019s baby. Flat-out dropped my cousin\\u2019s baby on the ground. But I don\\u2019t feel like that was my fault. I don\\u2019t feel responsible for that one, you know? Who in their right mind\\u2026 who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me, Anthony Jeselnik, to be a pallbearer? It\\u2019s okay, people hate\\u2026 people hate dead baby jokes. They hate them. They hate them. It\\u2019s like, \\u201cAnthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? Why do you have so many dead baby jokes?\\u201d \\u201cNo one likes them, why do you insist?\\u201d Well, I\\u2019ll tell you why. Because dead baby jokes have made me rich. And who was it? Who was it who said the first million is the hardest? Was it Hitler? Didn\\u2019t see that one coming, did you? That was a good response. Most audiences just pretend I didn\\u2019t say it. But I like it. I like making Hitler jokes. It\\u2019s cool for me. I enjoy it. Hell, I lost my grandfather. I lost my grandfather in the Holocaust Museum. It was the Holocaust Museum of Modern Art. Which is just like a normal Holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, \\u201cOh! I should have thought of that.\\u201d My grandmother died about a year ago. And I didn\\u2019t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. But I was wrong. It was fine. The hard part, the upsetting part\\u2026 was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. She wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh\\u2026 You, radio winner. What\\u2019s the best way you can die? This is not a trick question. \\u2013 In your sleep? \\u2013 Yes, thank you. Thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. Not me. I want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. But my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. We thought that\\u2019s how she went. We were all excited for her. But then we did an autopsy. Found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. During an autopsy. It was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. She always said her grandkids didn\\u2019t pay enough attention to her and\\u2026 and she was right. She was dead on. But I loved my grandma. Loved her very much. My grandma taught me about a lot. Taught me what religion is. Taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. I\\u2019ll tell you now. When I graduated from high school\\u2026 When I graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, \\u201cAnthony, I\\u2019m so proud of you. You\\u2019re my first grandchild to get to go to college. What can I do for you, what can I give you before you go to college?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cHonestly, Grandma, all I need from you is money.\\u201d Yeah, I know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. And my grandma said, \\u201cOkay, Anthony, I understand.\\u201d Couple months go by. It\\u2019s the end of summer. I\\u2019m packing up my dad\\u2019s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. Says, \\u201cAnthony, here, before you leave, take this.\\u201d And she handed me a brand-new Bible. King James Version. And I said, \\u201cThanks, Grandma, that\\u2019s exactly what we talked about.\\u201d I got in the car and I went off to school. Couple of weeks go by, I\\u2019m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. It\\u2019s my grandma. \\u201cAnthony, just calling to see how college is going.\\u201d \\u201cGrandma, college is the best. I\\u2019m having the time of my life. But to be honest, I\\u2019m starting to run low on money, and I could use a little bit, like we talked about.\\u201d She said, \\u201cOkay, well let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cTotally, Grandma, I\\u2019m on chapter four.\\u201d She said, \\u201cOkay, Anthony, I guess I\\u2019ll talk to you later.\\u201d Hung up the phone. Couple of months go by. Now I\\u2019m really starting to struggle financially. Might have to drop out of school, so I call my grandma in a panic. I say, \\u201cPlease, it\\u2019s Anthony. I\\u2019m having the time of my life in college. But if I wanna graduate, and I do, I need you to send me some money like we talked about.\\u201d She said, \\u201cAnthony, let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYes, Grandma! I wish it was longer!\\u201d And she said, \\u201cOkay, Anthony. I guess I\\u2019ll talk to you later.\\u201d Finally, it\\u2019s the end of the school year. I\\u2019ve got straight A\\u2019s, but I\\u2019m dropping out of college, \\u2019cause I have no more money left. And I\\u2019m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. It\\u2019s my grandma. \\u201cAnthony, I heard you\\u2019re dropping out of school today. How come?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou know goddamn well how come, Grandma! \\u2018Cause you wouldn\\u2019t give me any money.\\u201d She said, \\u201cAnthony, let me ask you this: Did you read your Bible?\\u201d And I just hung up the phone. I was so pissed off. Took everything out of that room. Last thing I took off the shelf, the last thing I took out of that room, was that Bible my grandma had given me. Took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, I actually opened it up. And on the very first page, in my grandmother\\u2019s handwriting, it said, \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d Thank you everyone. I hope you enjoyed the jokes I prepared for you tonight. And all the jokes I write, they\\u2019re all made up, they\\u2019re all fake, except for Eric Clapton and the Challenger. Everything else\\u2026 everything else is fake. But everything I\\u2019m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that\\u2019s all true. Now\\u2026 I don\\u2019t tell dark jokes because I\\u2019m a comedian. I\\u2019m a comedian because I tell dark jokes. I\\u2019m kind of fucked up, all right? I\\u2019ve always been this way. I can\\u2019t really help myself. It gets me into trouble a lot. I lose friends. It\\u2019s ruined relationships with people in my family. For instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. I did love her very much. She was a big fan of mine. And I was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. Horrible mistake. No one should ever ask me to speak at anyone\\u2019s funeral. I asked a friend for advice. Was like, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?\\u201d \\u201cAnthony, just go up there and tell a story. Find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. And don\\u2019t tell a joke. Try not to.\\u201d So I walked up and was like, \\u201cYou know what my favorite memory was? When I was like four years old, before I learned to read, Grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this Southern accent, and she would read to me. She would read Mark Twain to me, and I loved it. Like\\u2026 Mark Twain out of my grandma\\u2019s mouth, it would just come to life.\\u201d And then I couldn\\u2019t help myself. I said, \\u201cAnd I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the \\u2018N\\u2019 word.\\u201d Now I promise you\\u2026 I promise you\\u2026 until you\\u2019ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife\\u2019s funeral\\u2026 \\u2026at a Methodist Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi\\u2026 you are not a real comedian. I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I\\u2019m one of the best comedians of all time. But here\\u2019s the thing. It doesn\\u2019t matter if you believe me. It really doesn\\u2019t matter. The important thing is that I would pass a lie detector test. I like to test myself. I like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. One of my favorite ways to test myself, I like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. The day they happen. I don\\u2019t believe in too soon. I\\u2019m on a tight schedule. And I\\u2019m good at it. I\\u2019m good at it. Like, the day of\\u2026 the day of the Aurora, Colorado Batman movie theater shooting. The day it happened, I went online, I went on Twitter, and I tweeted \\u201cOther than that, how was the movie?\\u201d Right? Right? Nailed it. Nailed it. And the reason I get away with that\\u2026 the reason I get away with stuff like that is I\\u2019m just the guy who does it. People are used to it from me. It would be weird if I didn\\u2019t make a joke the day of a tragedy. Which is why I was very surprised when I got in a lot of trouble the day of the Boston Marathon. Now, I don\\u2019t follow the news regularly. But I know the second a tragedy happens because I get 25 text messages saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t do it.\\u201d And whenever I see that\\u2026 whenever I see that, it makes me sad. It makes me sad \\u2019cause I know something horrible has happened. People will say, \\u201cAnthony, what\\u2019s funny about Aurora? What\\u2019s funny about the Boston Marathon? What\\u2019s funny about your grandmother\\u2019s funeral?\\u201d Nothing! Nothing is funny about those things. That\\u2019s where I come in. So I see these texts and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, no, what happened?\\u201d But I also think, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a job to do.\\u201d So I go online, I start reading about it. I don\\u2019t want to watch the footage. But I\\u2019ll read about what happened. And I think, \\u201cHow can I make someone laugh today?\\u201d And then I think, \\u201cI got it.\\u201d I go back on Twitter. And I tweet, \\u201cGuys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.\\u201d \\u201cEspecially the finish line.\\u201d And again, I think, \\u201cNailed it. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\u201d But then my phone starts to ring. And it\\u2019s my boss. Or should I say my former boss. And they say, \\u201cAnthony, this is unacceptable. You are not just a comedian today. You\\u2019re also the host of your own TV show, with your name in the title, on our network. You take this joke down right now or you\\u2019re fired.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cGo fuck yourselves.\\u201d And I meant it. I didn\\u2019t get into comedy for money or fame. I know that sounds wrong, because I\\u2019m dripping with both. I only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. And they said\\u2026 Sure. They said, \\u201cWell, Anthony, you don\\u2019t understand. You don\\u2019t understand at all. If you don\\u2019t take this joke down right now, if you don\\u2019t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they\\u2019re also out of a job.\\u201d And I\\u2019m ashamed to tell you this. I\\u2019m embarrassed to admit it. But in that moment, I folded, and I deleted the joke. \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m happy to fight for what I believe in. I\\u2019m happy to take the consequences for what I\\u2019ve done. But what I could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, \\u201cHey, buddy, no work for you on Monday. I had this sweet tweet.\\u201d Couldn\\u2019t do it. But as soon as I hit delete, I got mad and I regretted it. I would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, I\\u2019ll tell ya that. And I got mad for betraying myself and everything I believe in. I\\u2019m just as mad today as I was then. Just as mad. So mad, I had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cAnthony, we\\u2019re family. Why are you so upset? Can\\u2019t you see we did you a favor? Don\\u2019t you worry about your career?\\u201d Let me ask you, San Francisco, do I seem like I worry about my career? No. You know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? Because if they\\u2019re worried about their money, they wouldn\\u2019t have played the lottery in the first fuckin\\u2019 place. I do not worry about my career. And they said, \\u201cAnthony, the problem is when you make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you\\u2019re making fun of the victims, and that\\u2019s wrong.\\u201d But that\\u2019s not what I\\u2019m doing. Because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I\\u2019m wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. No one is ever\\u2026 No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, \\u201cHey, are we trending?\\u201d No. This is who I\\u2019m making fun of when I make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: \\u201cMy thoughts and prayers\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cMy thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.\\u201d \\u201cMy thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.\\u201d Do you know what that\\u2019s worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t forget about me today.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t forget about me.\\u201d \\u201cLots of crazy distractions in the news, but don\\u2019t forget how sad I am.\\u201d Those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. They\\u2019re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. You understand? Now I\\u2019m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. It\\u2019s fine. It\\u2019s embarrassing, but it\\u2019s fun. You can laugh at yourself. It\\u2019s not a reason to stop telling jokes. Maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. Trust me, that\\u2019s fun too. You guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? Well, I guess that\\u2019s what makes me me. On my television show, I once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called \\u201cShark Party.\\u201d All right? Now\\u2026 Some of you enjoyed it, but if you\\u2019ve never seen \\u201cShark Party,\\u201d you can never see \\u201cShark Party.\\u201d It\\u2019s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so I will explain it to you. I love sharks. I love sharks more than anything. People\\u2026 People I can barely fucking tolerate. Every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. Every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? So when I hear about a shark attack, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFuck, yeah.\\u201d Win one for the home team. So as soon as I get this show where I can do what I want, I say, \\u201cYou know what? I want to have a shark party. As soon as there\\u2019s a shark attack, we\\u2019re having a shark party.\\u201d And I get lucky. About a month into my run, this guy from New Zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. And I know exactly what to do. I\\u2019ve already got the script written. I walk on stage, in front of the cameras. I say, \\u201cLadies and gentlemen, this guy from New Zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. It\\u2019s time for a shark party.\\u201d Lights go down, music comes up. Six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. For way too long. A stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. Very tasteful. And then I stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. Which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. But I get to say my favorite thing I\\u2019ve ever said on television: \\u201cSmile, you son of a bitch. Shark party.\\u201d And in America, where I\\u2019m famous for those types of shenanigans\\u2026 everybody was like, \\u201cAnthony, that was fucked up.\\u201d \\u201cIt was fucked up to see you dance.\\u201d End of controversy. However, in New Zealand, where they don\\u2019t get my show, they\\u2019ve never seen me, and frankly, they don\\u2019t get out much\\u2026 the New Zealand media takes the video\\u2026 and they show it to the guy\\u2019s family. And they say, \\u201cWhat do you guys think about this?\\u201d And they say, \\u201cCrikey,\\u201d or whatever the fuck they say over there. The point is, all of New Zealand, all of New Zealand rises up against me. All 45 of those cunts rise up. And start threatening my life. Now, I don\\u2019t read the things that people write about me on the Internet. But I pay people who do. And they come to me, and they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve got some terrible news. Please sit down.\\u201d They say, \\u201cYou are getting a lot of death threats online from New Zealand because of \\u2018Shark Party.'\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cReally? New Zealand wants to kill me? That\\u2019s weird because they didn\\u2019t even kill the shark.\\u201d I said, \\u201cHow many death threats am I getting?\\u201d And they were like \\u201cOh, all of them. You are getting all of the death threats. What do you want us to do? We can send someone to talk to them. Extra security? What do you want?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo, forget about it. Leave it alone, don\\u2019t worry.\\u201d This might be hard for some to understand. I\\u2019ve said it several times tonight. Everyone is going to die. I know full well I am going to die. And most of us don\\u2019t get to choose how we check out. But if I die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? Best case scenario. If somebody murders me over one of my jokes, I immediately become a legend. I\\u2019m a comedy God. The Mount Rushmore of comedy is me, four times. I said, \\u201cCome on then.\\u201d My security guys are like, \\u201cOkay, Anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we\\u2019ve ever heard.\\u201d \\u201cBut you\\u2019re the boss. Okay.\\u201d And they leave. And then the next day they come back. And they say \\u201cAnthony, sorry to bother you again. I know you didn\\u2019t care yesterday, but it\\u2019s gotten much worse. You\\u2019re gonna wanna hear this.\\u201d They say, \\u201cSomeone from New Zealand tracked down your mom and dad\\u2019s phone number and address in Pittsburgh, posted that online\\u2026 and now your entire family is getting death threats from New Zealand.\\u201d And I have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. It never crossed my mind\\u2026 that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm\\u2019s way, for something I\\u2019ve done or I\\u2019ve joked about. And honestly, I would cut my throat for my jokes. I would give my life for what I do. But if anyone, and I mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone I cared about because of a joke I\\u2019ve made? Even better. This man is fantastic\\nI watched the show 10 times  and I laughed so much everytime Except for the Eric Clapton joke and Sharky Party all is forgivable.  Great material. So a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is okay but a joke about a famous musician\\u2019s son falling to his death isn\\u2019t?  Where are your priorities? They\\u2019re just jokes.  It\\u2019s just syllables formed together.  They\\u2019re just words. People are monsters, these are just words Your email address will not be published.

[crowd cheering] [upbeat music playing] [crowd continues cheering] [music fades] Thank you. Thank you, Hawaii! I\\u2019m turning 38, so I\\u2019m harvesting my wife\\u2019s eggs this year. I\\u2019m harvesting my wife\\u2019s eggs so that we can make embryos, so we can freeze the embryos, so that we do not have to have kids right now because kids are what you have when you\\u2019ve given up on your own hopes and dreams. [crowd laughing] I\\u2019m still trying here! I look at my friends who are my age who have kids, and they all look like shit. [crowd laughing] It\\u2019s gotten to the point where I can\\u2019t even take a photo with them and post it on my main grid because it messes up the aesthetics of my Instagram too much. With their fucking haggard faces. Just drooping, wrinkly crow\\u2019s-feet-embedded heads. Receding hairlines. Just withering, graying hair coming out in clumps. Because of their children. Like, I did a show, and someone I went to high school with in Singapore came to the show, and after the show, I met up with them, and they brought another person with them, and I was like, \\u201cOh, is this other person your mom?\\u201d \\u201cThank you so much for bringing your mother to my show.\\u201d And that other person was also someone I went to high school with. [crowd laughing] That\\u2019s how fucking ugly\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026these people have become because of their children. Just unrecognizable. So I\\u2019m trying to use money and science to push the curve back a little bit. And, um, first step of harvesting my wife\\u2019s eggs is, I have to inject my wife twice a day for two weeks. So, I have to inject my wife. I am the one injecting my wife twice a day for two weeks. Zero medical training. I was given no medical training whatsoever. The government lets you do this. The\\u2026 The doctor asked me to do it. The doctor was like, \\u201cHey, have you ever held a needle before?\\u201d \\u201cNo? Perfect, here, take this, and inject your wife in the middle of her body, like Nicolas Cage in The Rock.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cTwice a day for two weeks with chemicals that we mail to you.\\u201d \\u201cMystery chemicals that we send to your house in unmarked brown boxes.\\u201d \\u201cJust trust us that it\\u2019s the right thing that you\\u2019re injecting into the person you love the most.\\u201d Internet chemicals that show up\\u2026 It comes in a powder! I have to make it into a liquid, you understand? It\\u2019s a meth lab in my kitchen as I\\u2019m mixing\\u2026 the comp\\u2026 I\\u2019m sweating the whole time \\u2019cause I\\u2019m scared I\\u2019ll fuck up the measurements and kill my wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely, then you have to, like\\u2026 The air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements. And then you have to put it in the syringe. Then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude like you know what you\\u2019re doing. [crowd laughing] [scattered applause] I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing! I saw someone do this on Doogie Howser. [crowd laughing] [crowd whooping] I don\\u2019t even know the angle to put it into her. [chuckling] Like, it looks so painful going in, like\\u2026 I love my wife so much I can\\u2019t even bear to watch her in pain. I couldn\\u2019t even bear to watch the needle go into her. I had to inject my wife like this. I had to, like, cover my eyes, and, like, backhand it\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026into her like Kurosawa. [imitates sword slash] \\u201cDid I get the middle of your body?\\u201d \\u201cNo?\\u201d \\u201cOkay, just walk into the needle!\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cI\\u2019m supposed to do all the work here? Meet me halfway.\\u201d And, uh, the doctor said, \\u201cIf you do everything right, if you\\u2026 measure correctly, you inject at the right times, they scan, like, this part of her body, you know, that Chicago Bulls logo. Right? And they were like\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026\\u201dIf you do everything right, based on what we can tell, you should expect 15 eggs.\\u201d [inhales] And my wife ended up getting 26. [scattered whooping and applause] Yeah. Always a\\u2026 [applause] Yeah, always like a late, half-hearted response to\\u2026 [crowd laughing] Usually, the women in the crowd are like, \\u201cWhoo, yeah.\\u201d All the men in the crowd are always like\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u201cIs that a good number?\\u201d \\u201cIs 26 a good number of eggs?\\u201d \\u201cHow many eggs equal one bebe?\\u201d \\u201cIs it four eggs is one bebe?\\u201d \\u201cSo 26 eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together\\u2026\\u201d Let me put this in a language that men can understand, okay? Twenty-six eggs from one vagina, in one cycle, is MVP numbers. [crowd laughing] Twenty-six eggs is like, if Magic Johnson averaged the triple-double and killed his own AIDS. [crowd laughing] Okay? That\\u2019s the level of medical miracle that\\u2019s happening in whatever this part of my wife\\u2019s body, that horn of the bull that, like, curls into itself. The doctor, like, scraped out 26 eggs out of my wife\\u2019s vagina, like salmon roe. Just scooping out. Just dripping out, and then you put it in some nigiri, right? And then you eat it. That\\u2019s how babies are made. You gotta Salt Bae the eggs onto the ikura, and then you eat it. So, uh, we\\u2019re trying to make embryos. So, eggs, that\\u2019s just half the equation. I don\\u2019t know if you know how embryos are made, but eggs, that\\u2019s just half of it. She did her part admirably. So now I have to contribute my half of the embryo equation. So I\\u2019m sitting in the doctor\\u2019s office. [exhales] Like a wet pigeon, all right? And the doctor comes over. And the doctor\\u2019s a woman because of course she is. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cGood morning, Mr. Chieng.\\u201d \\u201cSo, um, when\\u2019s the last time you ejaculated?\\u201d My wife is right here, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, when is the last time you ejaculated?\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cWe would all like to know.\\u201d It\\u2019s the one time in life where you\\u2019re not allowed to lie about jerking off. It\\u2019s when a medical professional is asking you a direct question. And it\\u2019s for reproduction. It\\u2019s for the intended purpose, so you gotta tell the truth. So I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhatever, I\\u2019ll tell the truth.\\u201d \\u201cUh, let me check my calendar, uh\\u2026\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cI guess the last time I ejaculated was, um\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cLet me see\\u2026 Uh, yesterday, around 3:00 p.m.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And my wife is like, \\u201cYesterday\\u2026 I was with you all day.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And I was like, \\u201cYeah, but remember when you took out the trash?\\u201d [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] Because I also put up MVP numbers. Against a shot clock. And heavy defensive pressure. But I was thinking of you the whole time. It\\u2019s really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever Vietnamese people eat. My wife is Vietnamese. I\\u2019ve no idea what the fuck she eats. N\\u01b0\\u1edbc m\\u1eafm. [chuckles] And I went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off. It\\u2019s the medical jerking-off room. Every hospital has a medical jerking-off room. Okay? It\\u2019s nondescript, not a lot of signage. Smaller than I think it should be. Lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt. And I\\u2019m sitting in a medical jerking-off room. By myself. And there\\u2019s grown men outside the door, waiting for me to finish\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026so they, too, can use the medical jerking-off room that we are sharing like a WeWork. [crowd laughing] And I\\u2019m in a medical jerking-off room by myself. And\\u2026 I couldn\\u2019t go! Okay? Sorry! Sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand. I\\u2019m sorry! Sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me! Sorry! Sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters, as they code to death painfully, and the families crying in the waiting room wasn\\u2019t turning me on. [crowd laughing] So I couldn\\u2019t go. I couldn\\u2019t go. So I just call 911, right? I\\u2019m like\\u2026 [chuckles] [crowd laughing] I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThese people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room.\\u201d Uh, I call the doctor back in, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDoc, I can\\u2019t go.\\u201d \\u201cOkay? I can\\u2019t medically ejaculate under these circumstances.\\u201d \\u201cThe vibes are off.\\u201d \\u201cLet me go home. Let me go home to medically ejaculate. Can I do that?\\u201d And the doctor\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, you can go home, but, you know, as soon as it comes out of your body, it expires quicker than avocados in Hawaii, alright?\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got\\u2026\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cYou have, like, a 45-minute window before there\\u2019s like an exponential decreasing probability of\\u2026\\u201d [gibberish] I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, fine.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll go home, I\\u2019ll medically ejaculate, I\\u2019ll come back in 45 minutes, no problem.\\u201d So I go home, open the front door, ejaculate immediately. Alright? This is\\u2026 [crowd laughing] Alright? This is home court advantage. I know where everything is, I know what\\u2019s behind me. I look at the dripping garbage bag. [crowd laughing] It\\u2019s like a Pavlovian response at this point. Um\\u2026 I ejaculate into a cup. Okay? It\\u2019s a cup that they gave me. It\\u2019s not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen. [crowd laughing] That says, \\u201cWorld\\u2019s Best Dad\\u201d on it. [chuckles] It\\u2019s the cup that they use\\u2026 doctors give you to test your pee for drugs. It\\u2019s got a really tight cap, right? So, I ejaculate into the cup. It keeps overflowing, so I gotta keep, like, pouring it out. [crowd laughing] Just overwhelming amounts. [crowd laughing] It\\u2019s like Ghostbusters 2 up in here. [crowd laughing] [chuckling] I fill it to the brim, and then I scrape off the top, and then I\\u2026 And then I seal the cap as tight as I can, right? Get it really nice and tight. And then I\\u2026 I put it inside my T-shirt, next to my skin, under my armpit. Nice and snug. Because the doctor told me to do that. Because apparently, like the Titanic, your body heat will keep your people alive. And then I run downstairs, and I jump into a New York City taxi, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cTake me to Langone Hospital, please. Hurry up.\\u201d The taxi driver is like, \\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing with your hand?\\u201d \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, yeah, no, I\\u2019m fine.\\u201d \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s not me. It\\u2019s my\\u2026 my wife. She\\u2019s wait\\u2026 A person\\u2026 It\\u2019s my jizz.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And New York City taxis have seen much worse. So, the taxi driver was like, \\u201cOh, okay, cool.\\u201d \\u201cThank you for using a cup.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cUnlike the last two dudes who were back there.\\u201d Just raw dogging at the JFK, you know what I\\u2019m saying? And, uh, we get to the\\u2026 we get to the hospital, right? I open the taxi door. I run into the hospital. And because it\\u2019s New York City, someone on the sidewalk is like, \\u201cHey, yo! Hey, yo!\\u201d \\u201cWere you that guy in Shang-Chi?\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cAm I\\u2026 Yes, I was a minor character in the Marvel movie Shang-Chi, not the main guy.\\u201d And the guy\\u2019s like, \\u201cYo! Yo! Can I get a photo with you?\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, sure.\\u201d [crowd laughing] So, we take a photo like this. So, someone on the internet has a photo of me and this stranger. And I\\u2019m doing this. Like Napoleon. If you ever come across this photo, just know I am holding my own jizz. [crowd laughing] So feel free to tag it. [crowd laughing] He was very grateful. He was like, \\u201cAw, thanks so much, man.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo problem, man.\\u201d I shake his hand, right? [crowd laughing] Because I love meeting my fans. And I run into the hospital, right? Already hitting the 45-minute mark. End of the fourth quarter. There\\u2019s no time left on the clock. So I just take my jizz and I just throw a buzzer-beater. Right? The doctor, like, catches my jizz, like\\u2026 [crowd laughing] Like Odell Beckham. She just, like, one hand, grabs it, and, like, in the same motion, without even putting it down, she, like, alley-oops my jizz into my wife\\u2019s eggs, right? Just takes it, and she goes, \\u201cBoom, shaka-laka!\\u201d And, uh, my sperm goes into my wife\\u2019s eggs, and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg. Nobody knows. It\\u2019s a mystery. It\\u2019s a mystery of the universe. Nobody knows. When sperm goes into the egg, it\\u2019s unknowable. Ooh, it\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s like the event horizon on a black hole. No one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg. Sometimes, nothing happens. When sperm goes into the egg, sometimes, it becomes a bubble tea. [crowd laughing] Nobody knows where bubble tea comes from. It\\u2019s \\u201ctapioca.\\u201d The sperm goes into the egg, and then you shake it, and you go to Vegas, you throw it on the crap table\\u2026 And if you\\u2019re lucky, if you get a good dice roll, right? It becomes a blastocyst. That\\u2019s what we call future humans, blastocysts. It becomes embryos. The doctor, she\\u2019ll take all the embryos and she\\u2019ll look at them under the microscope, and she\\u2019ll grade the embryos. Like cocaine. [crowd laughing] She\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cOoh, yeah, these ones? These are A-grade embryos right here.\\u201d [snorting] [crowd laughing] \\u201cThese ones, these are\\u2026 these are B-grade embryos, so\\u2026 so I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cThese\\u2026 These ones? These are C-grade embryos\\u2026\\u201d [grumbles] \\u201cOh, and these ones?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, these\\u2026 these are\\u2026 These are D-grade embryos.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, these\\u2026 These will storm the Capitol someday.\\u201d Alright? So\\u2026 [crowd laughing] You don\\u2019t want that. And then\\u2026 [crowd cheering] And then you have to, like, draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics. And you don\\u2019t know. You\\u2019re just projecting data. You just hope you\\u2019re not throwing away a Tom Brady in the 12th round that\\u2019s going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you can\\u2019t measure the human spirit. And, uh, we all like to think we\\u2019re good people in this room, but we\\u2019re all picking the A-grade embryos, okay? No one here is not picking your A-grade embryos if given a choice. Even if you were a B-grade embryo. [crowd laughing] You would still pick your A-grade embryos. Because you\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cI know what it\\u2019s like.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not putting my kids through this B-grade human existence, with sweaty palms and sciatica.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cGive me the A-grade shit. Give me the best we could do.\\u201d \\u201cGive my kid a fighting chance.\\u201d And it got me thinking about the future a little bit because I never wanted kids. I never thought I would have kids. The only thing I ever wanted to do my whole life was this. Stand-up comedy in America. [crowd cheering] It\\u2019s the best. Look at this. It\\u2019s the best. You are cheering because you know this is way better than having kids. [crowd laughing] [crowd whooping] So much more fun and lucrative. Well, the blastocysts are real now. There\\u2019s eight of them waiting for me in the cloud. Um\\u2026 33% chance of successful implantation with grade-A embryos. So, I guess that makes me a mass murderer in Alabama. It got me thinking about the future. What kind of parent am I gonna be? Am I gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were, or am I gonna be better than my parents were? Be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck you\\u2019re supposed to be now, and\\u2026 Thinking about it, turns out I\\u2019m gonna be just as bad as my parents were. I can\\u2026 I can feel it. I can feel it inside me. I can feel the\\u2026 I can feel the Chinese inside me. I can just feel that high expectation, just low tolerance for excuses. It\\u2019s in here. It\\u2019s right in here. It\\u2019s like the default app. You know, you can\\u2019t delete the calculator app. There\\u2019s no \\u201cX.\\u201d When you shake it, there\\u2019s no \\u201cX.\\u201d You can move it off the home screen, but it\\u2019s still in the OS, embedded. [crowd laughing] In the operating system, I can feel the Chinese. If my blastocyst was real, if it entered this reality, and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever. \\u201cOh my God, look at this blastocyst.\\u201d \\u201cEverybody, look. Look at how beautiful this blastocyst is.\\u201d \\u201cI love you so much, blastocyst.\\u201d \\u201cI love you much more than I thought I would.\\u201d [kisses] And your blastocyst is hugging you back, right, they\\u2019re like\\u2026 [in child\\u2019s voice] \\u201cI love you too, Daddy.\\u201d \\u201cDaddy, Daddy.\\u201d \\u201cWhen I grow up, I want to be a stand-up comedian.\\u201d \\u201cJust like you.\\u201d [crowd laughing] I just feel the Chinese coming on, right? I just\\u2026 [crowd laughing] You take your glasses off like Hitler in the bunker. [crowd laughing] \\u201cStand-up comedy? Are you out of your fucking mind?!\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cThat\\u2019s not even a real job!\\u201d \\u201cWhat do you think is gonna happen?\\u201d \\u201cJust gonna run around America and tell jokes to strangers who don\\u2019t give a fuck about your mental health?\\u201d \\u201cAnd even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds, and make it to even a semi-professional level as a stand-up comedian, do you think there\\u2019s any chance in hell you\\u2019ll be funnier than me?!\\u201d [crowd laughing] [applause] [crowd cheering] \\u201cDad is a borderline arena act in some markets!\\u201d \\u201cHave you seen my IMDb page?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m in everything! I will fucking crush your career!\\u201d Osoto gari! \\u201cYour mother and I just spent a fortune to make an A-grade blastocyst for them to become a B-grade comedian.\\u201d \\u201cI will never watch anything you do.\\u201d \\u201cGo to law school!\\u201d [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] Is what my father said to me. [crowd laughing] I do think it\\u2019s tough for straight men in 2024 to sincerely look up self-improvement on the internet without five weeks later storming the Capitol, okay? That men\\u2019s self-help YouTube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now. Okay? I\\u2019m not saying it\\u2019s the biggest problem in the world. Clearly. But it is a problem, okay? Because men were genetically predisposed to seek self-improvement. Okay? We\\u2019re trying to be better people every day. Believe it or not, women. [crowd laughing] Once we hit a certain age, okay? Usually we die before then. Through suicide or environmental factors. BMX biking, dietary choices\\u2026 But if you can live long enough as a man, you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective, okay? You start seeking guidance from outside sources. You start looking at watches. Like\\u2026 Like every man in this room has or will at some point. We\\u2019ve all been there. Guys, we\\u2019ve all done this. We\\u2019ve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives. And we\\u2019ve been like, \\u201cWhat a fucking piece of shit.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cI fucking hate this loser.\\u201d \\u201cLook at this loser.\\u201d \\u201cFuck this loser. I hate this person.\\u201d \\u201cI need to be a better person.\\u201d \\u201cLet me start by getting fit.\\u201d [crowd laughing] [woman screams] \\u201cLet me work on my health.\\u201d \\u201cThat seems like a logical place to start my journey.\\u201d \\u201cLet me control what I can control in here.\\u201d So what do you do as a man? You go on YouTube, right? You look up how to lift weights. Right? You press \\u201cEnter.\\u201d You click on the first video. It\\u2019s some guy doing kettlebell swings, right? He\\u2019ll teach you how to lock your core so you don\\u2019t break your fucking spine. And then you do that for two days. You feel pretty good about yourself. [man] Whoo! Right? And on the third day, the same YouTube channel has a new video notification alert, The men are like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s this new video from kettlebell-swinging guy?\\u201d \\u201cWhat could he be doing in his new video?\\u201d In the video, the kettlebell-swinging guy, he\\u2019s doing the new kettlebell exercise. \\u201cThe lawnmower.\\u201d He\\u2019s doing that. And then, like 30 seconds into the video, he just, suddenly, just stops. And he looks really sad. And he puts the kettlebell down. And he looks straight into the camera. And he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYo, guys, just real talk for a second, all right?\\u201d [sniffles] \\u201cKettlebells are great, but I just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And all the men watching this are like, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d [sniffles] \\u201cYeah, that makes sense.\\u201d \\u201cThat feels right, in here.\\u201d \\u201cTell me more, kettlebell-swinging guy.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cWhat other advice do you have for all areas of my life?\\u201d \\u201cIncluding my relationships and financial investments.\\u201d \\u201cPlease give me guidance, kettlebell-swinging guy.\\u201d So what do you do? You watch his next video on autoplay. Then you watch his next video. Here comes the YouTube algorithm with a suggested video. And here comes another suggested video. And a week later, Jordan Peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men. [crowd laughing] Five weeks later, you\\u2019re storming the Capitol dressed like a buffalo. [crowd laughing] [applause] [crowd cheering] That\\u2019s a very realistic sequence of events, by the way. That\\u2019s not even an exaggerated timeline. Every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm. We all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that men\\u2019s self-help, Andrew Tate masculinity, YouTube self-help algorithm. If you don\\u2019t know anyone who lost their mind\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026you\\u2019re the one who lost their mind. You\\u2019re currently in an echo chamber of assholes. \\u2018Cause real friends tell you when you\\u2019re losing your mind. It\\u2019s very tragic. All these men who are trying to be better people, and they\\u2019re seeking guidance. But that YouTube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves. There\\u2019s tragedy in that. Like all those people. They were just trying to lift weights. [crowd laughing] They weren\\u2019t trying to cause an insurrection. They didn\\u2019t even know what that word meant. They were just trying to do this. They\\u2019re trying to do this. They didn\\u2019t know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis-\\u00e0-vis their torso, right? Is it 90 degrees or 45 degrees? Like, is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you\\u2026? They Googled it one time, and then, five weeks later, you\\u2019re taking a shit on Nancy Pelosi\\u2019s desk. [crowd laughing] And the US Marshals are garnishing your wages. Because you take one wrong turn, and life moves pretty quick! I\\u2019m not saying, as a man, don\\u2019t take responsibility for your own actions. Okay? I\\u2019m just saying that YouTube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys. It\\u2026 It sucks men in in a way that I don\\u2019t think women understand. It really preys on that men\\u2019s need to seek guidance from somewhere. It\\u2019s very hard to resist. It just draws\\u2026 draws you in. That\\u2019s why fucking Mark Zuckerberg is trying to MMA fight Elon Musk right now. [crowd laughing] That guy fell for his own algorithm. Do you understand? Mark Zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd. And for, like, 20 years now, he\\u2019s just been looking at our data, right? Jerking off every single day. Just looking at our data, jerking off. Money piling up. Billions of dollars. Data. Jerking off. Money, money, jerking off, data. For 20 years, that loop. And who knew after two decades of that, one day, he just looked at so much data, he was like, \\u201cOh shit, oh shit.\\u201d He fell into it. Now he\\u2019s trying to MMA-fight Elon Musk. That guy jerked off and came on his own face. [crowd laughing] Like, it\\u2019s out of control. Zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality. And he invented that shit, and he still fell for it. What hope does the average man in America have? Just walking\\u2026 Just waddling down the street looking\\u2026 looking for a taco on his phone. He\\u2019s gonna get sucked into his phone. He has no chance. That fucking guy has no chance. Because even the good guys in this room\\u2026 we\\u2019re all, like, on a razor\\u2019s edge to being a piece of shit, okay? [crowd laughing] That margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razor-thin. I gotta tell you. If you have the means, every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge. And you know what? An Instagram post could push it either way! [crowd laughing] Okay? It depends on the post. Was it cute animals or was it boobs? [crowd laughing] That\\u2019s gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours. I do think, as a society, we need to, uh, do a better job of identifying, like, when we have a disagreement with someone who\\u2019s genuinely trying to have a good-faith discussion to reach higher understanding, and who\\u2019s just talking shit. We are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit, and we\\u2019re not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics. Like, for example, me, right now, I\\u2019m just talking shit, okay? [crowd laughing] This is one-way shit-talking. I don\\u2019t care about any of your opinions. Do not send me any of them. I do not care. You paid for me. I didn\\u2019t pay a cent for any of you, okay? [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] Free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shit-talking session. If you don\\u2019t like it, take it out on Adam Smith. But if I was having a conversation with someone I disagree with, in good faith, I would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with. That\\u2019d be a logical place to start a difficult conversation. For example, MAGA. Make America Great Again. They have a point. America\\u2019s not doing so great right now. Right? Our kids\\u2019 math scores are down. [crowd laughing] Our children\\u2019s science scores are down. When judged according to international metrics, uh, healthcare systems not doing so great. Wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially. There was an implied promise to a generation of Americans that if you do certain things, work hard, go to college, be a good person, you would have certain outcomes. And those outcomes didn\\u2019t materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decision-making positions lowered the capital gains tax\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year. In post-World War II, US leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for National Security by making the US dollar the default international trade currency, which gave America the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a US financial banking system, but consequently increased the value of the US dollar astronomically, which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in America. [inhales deeply] Although the logic at the time\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026was that Americans were supposed to upskill en masse, away from the menial manufacturing jobs, but everyone here\\u2019s too much of a dumbass to stay school, so we just traded domestic manufacturing to Asia and the rest of the world at the expense of working-class families. But if you don\\u2019t read enough\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026it comes out as, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go, Brandon!\\u201d [crowd laughing] And it\\u2019s like, you have a point, but you don\\u2019t have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didn\\u2019t read enough. You gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag. There\\u2019s a book behind the word. You gotta keep going. You can go at your own pace, but you gotta finish the required reading. Otherwise, we can\\u2019t have a conversation. We\\u2019re all catching up to each other. I\\u2019m friends with MAGA. I\\u2019m friends with the MAGAs. Some of them are my good friends. [man] Whoo! Yeah. Hawaii MAGA. [crowd laughing] The friendliest of all MAGA. [crowd laughing] Aloha MAGA. They\\u2019re in Hawaii right now, Making Aloha Great Again. I became friends with them because I filmed two seasons of a TV show in Hawaii, Doogie Kame\\u0101loha, on Disney+. [crowd cheering] [applause] MAGA Hawaii welcomed me into their homes. \\u201cRonny, please, come over. Please, we\\u2019re having a barbecue.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019d love you to meet the family, meet the ohana, please.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019d love to have you over.\\u201d So gracious. You show up, they\\u2019re so warm and welcoming. \\u201cThanks for coming. Take whatever you want.\\u201d \\u201cThere\\u2019s some Kalua pork, there\\u2019s some loco mocos, hot dogs.\\u201d \\u201cHey. Here. Here.\\u201d \\u201cTouch my gun.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cTouch it. Just touch\\u2026 Just take it.\\u201d I\\u2019m always like, \\u201cI\\u2026 I don\\u2019t want to touch any of these guns, okay?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t know where they\\u2019ve been. I don\\u2019t know where they\\u2019re going.\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t have time in my schedule to attend depositions.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cJust give me the loco moco.\\u201d [crowd laughing] Very passionate people, my MAGA friends. And I respect their passion to some extent. I do. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI love America. I would die for this country.\\u201d And I believe them. I believe they love America, and I believe they would die for this country, which is very admirable. But it\\u2019s like, man, you are willing to die for your country. Why aren\\u2019t you willing to learn math? [crowd laughing] Also for your country, like\\u2026 Like, do both for your country. I know you wanna die for your country, but we\\u2019re losing the engineering jobs to Asia right now. So if you\\u2026 We need less people to die for their country. We need more people to do their homework for their country. Like, do your homework for your country. Like, actually sit down and show the work, and, like, do the\\u2026 That\\u2019s a more efficient way to show your patriotism. If you take that \\u201cI want to die\\u201d energy and you put it into homework, you will fucking top the school, I\\u2019m telling you. It\\u2019s\\u2026 Sky\\u2019s the limit. [crowd cheering] Dude, you\\u2019ll\\u2026 you\\u2019ll solve a lot of problems, you\\u2019ll create a lot of jobs, you\\u2019ll increase the GDP. Just do\\u2026 do your homework for your country. \\u201cI\\u2019d rather die!\\u201d [crowd laughing] I\\u2026 I thought so. I thought that might be\\u2026 I thought that might be the case. Dying\\u2019s easy, math is hard. [crowd laughing] These quadratic equations making me suicidal. Uh, we try not to talk about politics, my MAGA friends and I, out of mutual respect. Inevitably, it comes up. Some stuff I\\u2019m wrong about, some stuff they\\u2019re right about, but sometimes, like, their messaging is so convoluted. Like, I can\\u2019t get to what their core issue actually is, because their surface messaging is so chaotic. Like, sometimes they\\u2019re like, \\u201cRonny, China caused COVID, but COVID isn\\u2019t real.\\u201d [crowd laughing] So, is it fine then? Does it mean it\\u2019s fine? I don\\u2019t know how to feel about it now. \\u2018Cause one minus one is zero. I don\\u2019t know what to tell you. The\\u2026 The math analogy works for concepts, not just numbers, you can\\u2026 \\u201cX\\u201d is anything. Why are you yelling at me about China? Always yelling at me about China. \\u201cChina is doing this. China did a weather balloon, with a camera.\\u201d \\u201cChina\\u2019s got an artificial island in the Pacific doubling as an aircraft carrier base.\\u201d \\u201cChina\\u2019s doing TikTok. Why is China doing TikTok?!\\u201d I don\\u2019t know. [crowd laughing] I\\u2019m not from China. I\\u2019m from Malaysia. [scoffs] I\\u2019m from Malaysia, not China. I\\u2019m\\u2026 I\\u2019m third-generation Chinese Malaysian. Malaysia. You know Michelle Yeoh? Oscar winner? Malaysia? Yeah, that\\u2019s Malaysia. Sama-sama. Malaysia. Saya anak Malaysia. Malaysia. Malaysia, not China. Malaysia. We are the ones who lost the plane. [crowd laughing] Okay? You guys remember that? Did you see the documentary on Netflix, suggested after my special? You guys see that? That was us. [crowd laughing] That was us. We\\u2019re the \\u201close the plane\\u201d people. Okay? We\\u2019re not the human rights whatever\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know\\u2026 TikTok\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know what that is, okay? We\\u2019re the\\u2026 [mimics plane engine] \\u201cAh! Where is it?! Where the fuck is it?!\\u201d That\\u2019s us. Uh, my\\u2026 my MAGA friends all hate US tax. That\\u2019s like a universal party platform. There\\u2019s different types of MAGA, right? There\\u2019s, like, MAGA light, MAGA concentrated, but, like\\u2026 Right, it\\u2019s unfair to group them under one banner, but one uniting party principle is, \\u201cLove America, fuck US tax.\\u201d And I get it. I also hate US tax now that I\\u2019m in the highest bracket. [crowd laughing] Yeah, I\\u2019m MAGA with that. Fuck US tax. Yeah, fuck American tax. Feels good to say it. Like the words give you power, right? Fuck US tax. Fuck American Tax. You like it? You like it when I say it? When this fucking foreigner says it? You like that? Fuck US tax. You like that? You like it when this accent says that? Fuck American tax. You like that? You don\\u2019t see a discrepancy in energy? \\u201cLove America, USA, USA.\\u201d \\u201cFuck US tax.\\u201d Put politics aside for just three seconds. Okay? If it\\u2019s even possible. Just for three seconds, just consider this concept in a vacuum. Just as an academic exercise, okay? When you love something, you give it money. [crowd laughing] Right? Like that\\u2019s one of the primary ways we show love for individuals, organizations, ideas on Kickstarter, sports teams\\u2026 We go like, \\u201cYeah, we give it money.\\u201d So when you go, \\u201cLove America, USA, USA.\\u201d \\u201cFuck US tax.\\u201d So what are you saying? You love America so much, you want it to be poor? You want your country to be poor? You want it to be a beggar on the street. A street beggar. You want your country to be a street beggar on the street? I love my mom. Sometimes I give my mom money. [crowd laughing] Give your mom money sometimes. [man] Yeah! Look how alien this concept is to white people. [crowd laughing] [applause] Just\\u2026 silence. [crowd laughing] Give your mom money sometimes. \\u201cFor what?!\\u201d [crowd laughing] Because she\\u2019s your Ma. [chuckles] And you love her, right? She loves you back, so fucking cut her off a piece every once in a while. Probably tore stuff giving birth to you, cut her a piece of the pie. Arbitrarily, even. Just give a\\u2026 I\\u2019m sure your mother would appreciate it. No matter who your mom is, how self-accomplished she is, I\\u2019m sure your mom could use it. Fix the driveway, invest in infrastructure. Something. [crowd laughing] Sometimes Americans treat their country the way they treat their parents. [indistinct chatter from crowd] Yeah. [crowd laughing] \\u201cI love my mom. I love my mom. I would die for my mom.\\u201d \\u201cBut fuck her, she made her choices.\\u201d [crowd laughing] I love being in America. I do. I love being here. I had my options. I came here. I love being in America because this is the country that puts show business above everything. And I am in the business of show business. So naturally, I\\u2019m gonna come here and do it. I do this in America, \\u201cFuck America. Fuck the president. Fuck US tax,\\u201d money, money just comes into\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u201cFuck the president.\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s too old. Fuck this president.\\u201d The money comes in. Money just comes in. Like printing money. I do this in Malaysia, same\\u2026 same words, same\\u2026 same clothing, same haircut, facing the same direction, in Malaysia? Jail. [crowd laughing] Like, the arbitrage value is out of control. Same product in different loc\\u2026 Obviously, I\\u2019ll do this here. Why the fuck would I do it anywhere else? It\\u2019s the best. I think, uh, sometimes people forget I\\u2019m a first-generation immigrant here. Because my second-generation or later American friends, like, their parents were immigrants. And the way they talk about their parents is so disrespectful. And they forget, like, I\\u2019m also an immigrant. They\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cYou know my parents? They\\u2019re immigrants.\\u201d \\u201cYou know immigrants. They\\u2019re so cheap.\\u201d [crowd laughing] Like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t come over. My family\\u2019s over this weekend. My parents are here.\\u201d \\u201cMy parents are immigrants. You know immigrants. Ugh!\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re so cheap.\\u201d Yo, I want to defend immigrants here for a second, all right? Fuck that shit. Yeah, my mom lives in Singapore. She is not an immigrant. She is still extremely cheap. [crowd laughing] Okay? Being cheap is not an immigrant thing. It\\u2019s genetic. [crowd laughing] Cheap people are cheap. They\\u2019re not choosing to be cheap. It\\u2019s just inside, it\\u2019s not a choice. Chinese baby boomers are cheap \\u2019cause they don\\u2019t know how to have fun. They haven\\u2019t had fun in, like, 50 years. They, like, forgot the energy of fun. Like, of all the Asians right now in the Asian fun hierarchy, from most fun to least fun, Chinese baby boomers, least fun of all the Asians right now. I can say this. I\\u2019m Chinese, okay? You don\\u2019t fucking say it. [crowd laughing] This is our \\u201cN\\u201d word. You don\\u2019t fucking say it. I say it. You don\\u2019t fucking say it. Least fun\\u2026 You don\\u2019t fucking say it. Least fun of all the Asians, Chinese baby boomers. Right now, of all the Asians, most fun Asians, uh, the Koreans, okay? You gotta give it up for the Koreans. [crowd cheering] [crowd laughing] Give it up for the Koreans. You gotta tip your cap and respect the back-to-back championships of the modern-day Koreans just killing it with the fun and the pop culture. They\\u2019re\\u2026 Everyone\\u2019s\\u2026 They\\u2019ve got Blackpink. They got music. They got BTS. [crowd cheering] Dude, BTS is right now in the army fighting Kim Jong-un. [crowd laughing] Do you understand? BTS is at the DMZ right now, just going\\u2026 [singsongs pop beat playfully] [mimics machine gun] [crowd laughing] Just an unstoppable force of entertainment. [chuckling] Taking down countries and dictatorships. They got, uh\\u2026 Koreans got, uh, the Parasite movie, Oscar-winning. They got Past Lives. They got, uh\\u2026 Crash Landing on You. [crowd cheering] Just dominating the Netflix home page of white people. [crowd laughing] Never thought I\\u2019d see the day when white people\\u2019s homepage is full of K-drama. Just binging. Non-stop. They got, uh, Squid Game. Dude, Koreans have more fun dying in Squid Game than Chinese people have at comedy shows. Chinese people at comedy shows, they\\u2019re looking at their phone. \\u201cDo I have to look up?\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s here? Okay, I\\u2019m gonna video for six minutes.\\u201d Full flash video. This is\\u2026 This is how I live in the moment as a Chinese person. Koreans, most fun. Uh, Filipinos know how to have fun. [crowd cheering] Yeah, they love having fun, uh\\u2026 Vietnamese people know how to have fun. Cambodians know how to have fun. Hmong people know how to have fun. Even Japanese know how to have fun. In a reserved way. [crowd cheering] Outwardly stoic. Inside, just anime. [crowd laughing] Outside, unreadable. Inside, just the intro to Sailor Moon. Right? Just\\u2026 [crowd laughing] [humming the intro to Sailor Moon] Outside is just, \\u201cOhayo gozaimasu.\\u201d [crowd laughing] Japanese people have so much fun sometimes they go straight back to work. [crowd laughing] \\u201cYou\\u2019re not gonna change your suit? Just straight into the office? Alright.\\u201d [chuckles] Uh\\u2026 Everyone knows Chinese baby boomers, least fun of all the Asians. Because for Chinese baby boomers, their primary directive in life is, \\u201cDo not get scammed.\\u201d That\\u2019s like the overriding directive that informs the entire decision-making tree. RoboCop, primary directive, \\u201cDo not get scammed.\\u201d \\u201cDo not arrest OCP executive.\\u201d \\u201cDo not get scammed.\\u201d And for Chinese baby boomers, there\\u2019s no value proposition, okay? It\\u2019s just pure price sensitivity. That means any money outgoing is a scam. [crowd laughing] \\u201cIf money leaves my possession, that was a scam!\\u201d [crowd laughing] So the whole time, they\\u2019re just tensed up, they\\u2019re just looking for scams when they go out. They\\u2019re just like\\u2026 They can\\u2019t even relax. \\u201cScam\\u2019s coming!\\u201d It\\u2019ll be a two-drink minimum over here. Parking guys, tip\\u2026 [grumbling] Tensing up. Meanwhile, Koreans in the back just having fun. [crowd laughing] Filipinos dancing like\\u2026 Chinese baby boomers just tensed up. The further they get from their house, as distance X increases, they know the fees will increase and so the ex\\u2026 The expenditures are gonna increase, so they keep tensing up. The further they get, until eventually, like, their whole body tenses up into, like, a \\u201cC,\\u201d right? Like a \\u201cC\\u201d for Chinese. [crowd laughing] And then, in the back you\\u2019re like, \\u201cGo, go, have fun! Have fun!\\u201d They just refuse to have fun. Like, my mom came and visited me in New York City. Her only son, she came to New York City. New York City is the kind of city where, as soon as you open your front door, it\\u2019s like $1.50. Like, if you touch your door knob, it\\u2019s like, Apple Pay $1.50, just going\\u2026 It goes into the universe. My mom came in and approached the front door in New York. She\\u2019s like in the back of the apartment, \\u201cI\\u2019m good, I don\\u2019t need to leave the house today.\\u201d My mom isn\\u2019t even scared of Asian hate. She\\u2019s more scared of inflation. [crowd laughing] She can\\u2019t believe the prices of things anymore. You take her out to Central Park. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go to Central Park, it\\u2019s free.\\u201d \\u201cLook how beautiful New York is in autumn. Look at this.\\u201d \\u201cWhy are these hot dogs five dollars? It\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo, this\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cThe price is right. No one is scamming you.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s the correct amount of money to pay for that.\\u201d \\u201cYou haven\\u2019t been out of the house in 50 years. That number is correct.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s how much things cost after baby boomers destroyed the global financial economy in 2010 pursuing subprime mortgages, okay?\\u201d That\\u2019s\\u2026 That\\u2019s\\u2026 If anything, you scammed yourself. That\\u2019s you scamming yourself. Yeah, \\u201cYou played yourself.\\u201d DJ Khaled. [crowd laughing] My mom came to visit me in Hawaii. Her first time in Hawaii. And if you know Hawaii, locals and the Hawaiians here, the least scammy culture on the planet. Could not be more generous as a community. You get so much more than you give when you\\u2019re on the islands of Hawaii. And, uh, my mom comes, and she lands, and she gets to the hotel, and they welcome her, \\u201cAloha. Welcome to Hawaii.\\u201d And they put a lei over her, like a ring of flowers. They put it over her, and my mom does this. [crowd laughing] \\u201cI\\u2019m not paying for that.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t do that, Mom.\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re not trying to trick you into buying something.\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re trying to welcome you to their homeland.\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re not tricking you into buying just \\u2019cause you touched it.\\u201d \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t Thailand. Just put on\\u2026\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cPut on the lei, you\\u2019re embarrassing me in front of the Hawaiians!\\u201d Mahalo. [crowd laughing] [applause] [crowd cheering] These Chinese baby boomers, most scared of being scammed in real life, the first to get scammed on the internet. For people who live in fear their entire lives, extremely gullible. Because these baby boomers, they don\\u2019t have the\\u2026 they don\\u2019t have the antibodies to deal with the internet. Completely clueless when they go on now. Like, watching baby boomers go on the internet now is like watching babies wandering into the kitchen by themselves, just looking for cookies on the kitchen countertop, just like\\u2026 Running their hands blindly on the kitchen countertop. Pulling down knives. Kitchen knives coming straight down into their eyeballs, into, like, the soft part of their skull. They go in the kitchen, they open the oven, they turn it on. They stick their head inside. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cAny pictures of my grandkids in here?\\u201d \\u201cIs this link safe to click on? Is this link safe to click on?\\u201d \\u201cIs this link safe to click on?\\u201d Just falling for every basic bitch internet scam possible. These fucking baby boomers tumbling into internet scams like pandas rolling down a hill. [crowd laughing] Just jujitsu-rolling into scams every single day. Loving scams. \\u201cOh, what do you want? 20 Target gift cards?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, sounds like a legitimate way to pay for antivirus software on my phone.\\u201d \\u201cEverybody, look. Look at this link. Look, there\\u2019s a\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018What\\u2019s the one trick your doctor doesn\\u2019t want you to know?'\\u201d \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll click on that link.\\u201d \\u201cI knew it. I knew my doctor was scamming me!\\u201d \\u201cThat was a trick he didn\\u2019t want me to know.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna invalidate his medical degree with one click right now!\\u201d [grunts] \\u201cThis is not the scam. My doctor is the scam. Let me\\u2026\\u201d [grunts] Click on this\\u2026 These fucking internet idiot savants who can\\u2019t remember a single goddamn password, but for some reason, can make any piece of misinformation go viral. Like a Russian cyber army, just spreading misinformation around the world in family group WhatsApp chats. Everywhere. \\u201cEverybody, just look at this article. Is this real?\\u201d \\u201cLook at it. Is this real?\\u201d It\\u2019s how they fact-check! They spread it. \\u201cLook at this, this is a real\\u2026? Everybody, weigh in.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not saying a hair dryer in your mouth will kill COVID.\\u201d \\u201cOkay? But what? You can\\u2019t ask questions anymore?\\u201d \\u201cLook at this article from cnn-n-n-n.ru.\\u201d \\u201cQuick, send it to your uncle, send it to your\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cSend it to our whole family tree. Everybody needs to see this.\\u201d Has there ever been a dumber generation of idiots more susceptible to fake news than these fucking baby boomers literally believing everything they see on the internet? I get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last, due to the exponential technology growth curve, okay? But this has got to be the biggest gap in human history! The information asymmetry right now is just out of control. You literally have people in Honolulu right now auto-driving their Tesla Cybertrucks as they vape out the window, and their phone AI is trading cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, you have baby boomers, they can\\u2019t even right-click. [crowd laughing] They can\\u2019t even right-click. \\u201cThere\\u2019s one button! How do you right-click on one button?!\\u201d It\\u2019s scary. They don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s real anymore. \\u201cHey, Ronny. Look at this photo of Bigfoot shopping at Whole Foods.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cBigfoot is real now!\\u201d \\u201cLook, there\\u2019s an image of him buying kombucha at Whole Foods.\\u201d \\u201cWhat technology exists that can fake images?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cMom, that\\u2019s not real. Stop sending it around. It\\u2019s not real.\\u201d \\u201cHow do you know?\\u201d They always get so indignant about it. Like, \\u201cHow do you know that it\\u2019s not real?\\u201d \\u201cHow did you know that?\\u201d Because the font, the font is off and the resolution of the image is blurry, and that lighting state doesn\\u2019t make sense for that image! And that\\u2019s not standard dimensions for a news article. I can\\u2019t give you this knowledge. It\\u2019s like Malcolm Gladwell\\u2019s Blink! I\\u2019ve seen so much shit on the internet, my brain instantly filters it. You\\u2019ll never have this skill set, so just stay off the internet! This world is not for you anymore! Stop making decisions! [crowd cheering and clapping] But anyway, respect your elders. [crowd laughing] It\\u2019s a Confucian value. Maybe if you give your mom some money, she wouldn\\u2019t get scammed so much. Yeah, well\\u2026 Think about the correlation between those two phenomena. Uh\\u2026 People always ask me, like, \\u201cWhy do you shit on your mom for money?\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you shit on your dad for money?\\u201d Alright, uh\\u2026 [chuckles] No, I don\\u2019t talk about my dad because, uh, my dad has no context for show business. Like, we grew up in Malaysia. Like, his families are rubber tappers in Malaysia. My aunts and uncles are still in Sitiawan in Malaysia right now tapping rubber. They have no context for show business. Very smart people, but they don\\u2019t know this world. My dad, he was the first guy in his family to get a college education. He went to Manchester College, which has merged with the University of Southern New Hampshire. He got his master\\u2019s of economics there. Put himself through it. Very smart guy. And he was a good immigrant. He came to America, to New Hampshire, to get his education, and when he graduated, he went back to Malaysia. He didn\\u2019t take anyone\\u2019s job, he left. [crowd laughing] And my dad had the vision to see what I didn\\u2019t see. He knew he had a ceiling on him, because of the way he thinks and talks, and he went back to Malaysia. And he was right! For him. He went back. It was the right choice for him. He became a very successful corporate executive. Uh, he retired to a farm in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Love farming. He retired to a farm. That\\u2019s how much this guy loved it, but he had no context for show business, so he wouldn\\u2019t understand anything I\\u2019m doing. Like, he wouldn\\u2019t understand what I\\u2019m doing in Godzilla vs. Kong. He\\u2019d be like, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you just run that way?\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cDad, I don\\u2019t control the edit. Okay?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m just Honolulu Chinatown shopkeeper No. 3 in this\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cIn this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla, okay?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m just connecting Act 1 to Act 2, I don\\u2019t have a say in how this plays out.\\u201d Because of that, I stopped telling him about what I was doing. I felt he wouldn\\u2019t get it, and he stopped asking me. So I didn\\u2019t tell him I got hired on The Daily Show. He found out the way all parents find out about their kids\\u2019 accolades, through a local newspaper. So, one day, the local paper reported that I got hired on The Daily Show, and he called me immediately. He was like, Ronny, what\\u2019s this I hear about you joining \\u201cThe Everyday Show\\u201d? And I was like, \\u201cOh no, it\\u2019s The Daily Show.\\u201d \\u201cI joined like two years ago, Dad.\\u201d He was like, \\u201cOh, okay. Well, what\\u2019s The Daily Show?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s just like another late-night American talk show.\\u201d \\u201cThey kind of invented modern American satire.\\u201d And\\u2026 [clicks tongue] And, uh, my dad was like, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s cool. Are you the host?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m a correspondent.\\u201d He was like, \\u201cWhat is that? What\\u2019s a correspondent?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, correspondent is, I help the host with comedy segments.\\u201d And he was like, \\u201cOh, okay.\\u201d \\u201cHey, Mei! He\\u2019s just a sidekick.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And so he had, like, no context for what was a win, what was a milestone in this industry. And so, I stopped telling him, and he stopped asking me. And I didn\\u2019t need that from him. We\\u2026 We were totally fine. We\\u2019d talk about other stuff. Not about work. We weren\\u2019t fighting. It was all good. Uh, and he passed away very suddenly, uh, in 2018. He died on Christmas Eve. Died on his farm, like, no warning, no explanation. He just left one day. He left so suddenly, we had to go back to handle his estate. If anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position, when you have to handle someone else\\u2019s estate, it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life. And so it\\u2019s me, my wife, my sister, brother-in-law, went back to Johor Bahru, and part of me trying to figure out his estate was I had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using. So, his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it, and I opened it up, and it\\u2019s password-protected, and I know this guy so well, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHis password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child.\\u201d So\\u2026 [crowd laughing] \\u2026I type in my sister\\u2019s birthday, and spot on. Spot on. It was my sister\\u2019s birthday. [crowd laughing] As it should be. She\\u2019s, like, an anesthesiologist in Australia. She\\u2019s like way more respectable person than me, actually saving lives like a good person. Contributing back to society, not like this fucking asshole. I get in\\u2026 [chuckles] I get in trouble on the internet for shit I said two years ago, every six weeks. So it should be her. She should be the favorite. So, I log into his computer, I open his web browser, I look at his browsing history, and the whole time, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cPlease don\\u2019t let me find my dad\\u2019s porn.\\u201d \\u201cPlease don\\u2019t let me find what positions my dad was into.\\u201d \\u201cEven if it was just missionary, I wouldn\\u2019t be able to handle it.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna have to burn this laptop.\\u201d For real Chinese people, when we burn things, it goes to our ancestors, and then my granddad is gonna see it, and it\\u2019s like, I don\\u2019t\\u2026 I don\\u2019t want that for them. I\\u2019ll be fine, but they\\u2019re gonna have an awkward time. I\\u2019m considerate like that, uh\\u2026 So I open the web browser, look at his history, and way to go, Dad, no porn. What a clean-cut guy. No porn. He only went on the internet twice a day. Like clockwork. 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Like the farmer that he was. And every time he went on the internet, he\\u2019d only go to two websites each time. So, the first website he\\u2019d go to was a local news website, and the second website he\\u2019d go to twice a day, every single day, was my Twitter page. [crowd] Aw\\u2026 So, he\\u2019d be reloading my Twitter page twice a day just to see what I was doing. And I post stuff like, \\u201cHey, Honolulu, Hawaii, I sold out five shows, uh, this week, why\\u2019s there so many homeless people here?\\u201d I\\u2019d post stuff like that. [crowd laughing] And, uh\\u2026 he would read that, and then he\\u2019d be like\\u2026 I assume, he\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOh, Ronny\\u2019s doing okay.\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s in Hawaii, he sold out some shows, and oh, I guess there\\u2019s a lot of homeless people in Hawaii.\\u201d Uh, and, um, that was his quiet way of keeping up with me. He never told me that, and I never knew that, and we never discussed it, um, which is a very nice sentiment. Unfortunately, uh, as best as I can tell, this is the last tweet my dad read of mine. [crowd laughing] So, as best as I can tell, forensically, based on internet browsing timestamps, the last tweet my dad read of mine, and quite possibly, the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm, was me posting on Twitter, \\u201cIf you\\u2019re a baby boomer on Twitter, I already know you\\u2019re a fucking loser.\\u201d [crowd laughing] Now, obviously, this was not directed towards him. I didn\\u2019t even know he had Twitter. I didn\\u2019t even know he knew what Twitter was. But I stand by the statement. [crowd laughing] [applause] And I know that\\u2019s kind of a weird way to end the show, but, um\\u2026 [crowd laughing] [chuckles] \\u2026if it\\u2019s any solace, uh, this was his phone when he died. [crowd] Aw! That was his, uh, wallpaper and his screensaver. And\\u2026 [chuckles] And I didn\\u2019t even know. And it\\u2019s a photo of me and my wife, and we\\u2019re in Hawaii. And I\\u2019m wearing two leis \\u2019cause my mom threw one off and I put it on. [crowd laughing] And, uh, I didn\\u2019t know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper. Uh, and\\u2026 [applause] Uh\\u2026 I\\u2026 I like to\\u2026 I like to think that, uh, that is the last image he saw of me. That\\u2019s what he remembered me by when he left. And, uh, I also would like to tell my sister, I won! [crowd laughing] I won! It was me! It was me! You guys have been great. Thanks for coming out, Honolulu.

              "\"Armed with boyish charm and a sharp wit, the former “SNL” writer John Mulaney offers sly takes on marriage, his beef with babies and the time he met Bill Clinton All right, Petunia. Wish me luck out there. You will die on August 7th, 2037. That’s pretty good. All right. Hello. Hello, Chicago. Nice to see you again. Thank you. That was very nice. Thank you. Look, now, you’re a wonderful crowd, but I need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? Because… No, no, no. Thank you. Some crowds… some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. So… I don’t judge those crowds, by the way, okay? We’ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. We’ve all made a “Happy Birthday” sign… Wait. You get that poster board up, and you’re like, “I don’t need to trace it. I know how big letters should be. To begin with, a big-ass ‘H’. Followed by a big-ass ‘A’ and… Oh, no! Oh, God! Okay, all right. Real skinny ‘P’ with a high hump, and then we’ll put the second ‘P’ below the hump of that first ‘P’, sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. And now I have no room for the ‘Y’, so I’ll do a kind of curled-up noodle ‘Y’. Block letters and cursive look good together.” And then you go to write “Birthday” and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with “Happy.” You’re like, “Yeah, but the past is the past. Big-ass ‘B’. Surely more letters will fit in the same space.” You’re very friendly here in Chicago. I mean, we’re all violent here, but you’re very friendly. No, really. And I don’t like confrontation, ’cause I’ve never been in a fight before. Though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment I walked out on stage. I don’t give off that vibe. Some people give off a vibe of… Right away, they’re like, “Do not fuck with me.” My vibe is more like, “Hey, you could pour soup in my lap and I’ll probably apologize to you.” When I walk, for real, my feet go out like this. I’m so open and vulnerable. I look like a doll that you point out molestation on. “Show us on this white comedian where the man touched you.” It’s been a while since I’ve been home to Chicago. I got married since then. Thank you. I married my wife. I love saying “my wife.” It sounds so adult. “That’s my wife.” It’s great, you sound like a person. I said it even before we were married. We were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and Anna’s ticket didn’t say anything and my ticket said “priority access.” It doesn’t matter why. But we were getting on and I said, “Uh, can my wife board with me?” And they were like, “Yes, of course. Right this way.” And I was like, “Oh, that is so much better than all those times I was like, ‘Can my girlfriend come?'” And, yeah, I shouldn’t have said it that way, but still. “My wife” just has some kick-ass to it, you know? “Get away from my wife! No one talk to my wife!” Marriage is gonna be very magical. “I didn’t kill my wife!” That’s like, “Ooh, who’s that fella? I bet he did kill his wife.” Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. That’s not really a joke, that’s just a little sweet thing I like to say. ‘Cause I’d been in relationships where I got cheated on, like, long ones. I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. ‘Cause when I was a kid, I used to watch America’s Most Wanted. You know how kids do. And I would always think to myself, “How could another person kill someone? How could a human being kill another human being?” And then I got cheated on, and I was like, “Oh, okay.” “I’m not gonna do it, but I totally get it.” And I don’t mean in that way of, like, “No one else can have you.” I don’t care about that. It’s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. They have a lot of information. Anyone who’s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. I can’t have them roaming around. I talked to a lot of people before I got engaged, you know. And I heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. This is an old expression. People say this. They say, “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You ever heard that before? It’s a bananas insulting expression… to an entire gender. But also, it makes no sense. “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You’re not allowed to milk a cow that you don’t own. That’s not even a situation. Was that a problem at one point? Like, in the dairy community? Was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? Some Dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, “Ah-ha-ha, I take your milk.” And the farmer was like, “Well, then, this is your cow now.” And he was like, “No, no proof of purchase.” And he ran off into the night. That sounded Dutch, right? You know what that… you know what that expression means? It means, “Why would you marry a woman if she’s already having sex with you?” Which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. Now, it’s like, “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you’re gonna buy it. And… … you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you can’t avoid that question at all. And also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. And the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like… And does not enjoy the sale at all… even though she’s the one that wanted to go to the sale. And she’s especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. “Why buy the cow?” Well, let’s be real here. You’re very lucky to have the cow that you do have. “Roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, John.” By the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and… a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought… They assume it. When you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, “John Mulaney bull?” And if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. They’ll still say it. ‘Cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but… But, for real, Chicago, why buy the cow? Let’s be real. Why buy the cow? Because you love her. You really do. And, yeah, yeah… Sure, she’s a bossy little Jew, but… … she takes care of you. And you don’t wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, “Hey, you seen any loose milk?” My wife is Jewish. She’s a New York Jew. I did it! Now, I was raised Catholic. I don’t know if you can tell that from the everything about me. My wife is Jewish, I grew up Catholic, so we got married by a friend. Being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. “What’s the name of the bishop?” “That’s actually stand-up comedian Dan Levy. He was the host of MTV’s Your Face or Mine?” I saw a lot of Catholic weddings, though, because I was an altar boy… And a hush falls over the room. Isn’t it weird how that became a scandalous thing? That was just some boring shit I had to do on weekends. But now, it’s like saying, “I was a French maid for a period of time. I was treated well in my day. I worked for a variety of sirs.” No, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? You’d serve Mass and then you’d serve weddings sometimes. My brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in Chicago where we grew up. And the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, “Aw, she’s ugly.” And then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. And I know that’s awful, but wouldn’t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? It was the best moment of this stupid woman’s life, and she’s walking down the aisle, and the organ’s like… And she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of God. And right at that second, for no reason at all, some Cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, 13-year-old prick decides to go, “Aw, she’s ugly!” Hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, “Aw, she’s beautiful. She’s enchanting.” I grew up Catholic. I don’t go to church anymore. But I went on Christmas Eve with my parents, ’cause you know how you lie to your parents. So… we go into the church and I was like, “I got this under control.” And then I got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. No, I was going through Mass and I was batting, like, .400. And then in the middle of Mass, the priest said, “Peace be with you.” And everyone said, “And with your spirit.” And I was the one pre-Y2K asshole going, “And also with you. What? Huh? What? Huh? What? When? When?” For those of you that aren’t Catholic, I don’t mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but… There’s a part in church where the priest says, “Peace be with you.” And for many, many years, we all said… – “And also with you.” – Very good. But they changed it to “And with your spirit.” Because that’s what needed revamping in the Catholic Church. That was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. In Rome, they were like, “Let’s see. What problems can we solve? Problem one. No.” I’m actually glad they changed that, though. I never liked “And also with you.” I always found that clunky. “And also with you.” That’s not how you talk. – “Have a nice day.” – “And also you having one.” It’s just a little bit wrong, isn’t it? It’s just a little off. Like, when someone’s like, “How are you?” And you’re like, “Nothing much.” And it sort of makes sense. Never begin a sentence with “And also.” You just immediately sound caught off-guard. It sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren’t expecting it. Like, the priest was like, “Hey, this is the first time we’ve ever had church. I just wanna say, ‘Peace be with you.'” And they were like… “What? Oh. Uh, yeah. And also you should have some.” “Hey, that’s good. Let’s keep that for 2,000 years. And then change it to trick John.” My wife and I don’t have any children, we have a dog. We have a little puppy named Petunia. She’s a tiny little French bulldog puppy. I like having a puppy that’s a bulldog, ’cause it’s like having a baby that is also a grandma. Her body is young, her face is as old as time. She definitely saw the Nazis march into Paris. She always gives me this look of like, “Oh, the things I have seen, you cocksucker. You have no idea. The Gestapo threw my printing press into a river. But, go, tell your fucking jokes. Bring me my dish.” She said that. Petunia… Petunia is my best friend in the world. I give her a million kisses a day. She does not like me, and barks at me and bites me all day long. We had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because Petunia is a bad dog. We tell her that every day. We go, “Hey, you’re bad at being a dog.” So, the trainer came into the apartment. Sorry, didn’t even walk into the apartment, walked into the threshold and went, “Oh, okay.” Like she was an exorcist or something. She said, “I see what the problem is.” She said, “Petunia has become the alpha of the house.” And then she pointed at me, she said, “You are no longer the alpha of the house.” And in the back of my head, I was like, “I was never the alpha of the house.” I turned to my wife, I was like, “Let’s pretend. It’ll be fun. Yes… My title of alpha, which I once had, how can I reclaim it? Because that was a thing that existed at one time.” She said, “You need to show dominance over your puppy.” These are things people say to me. I said, “How do I do that?” She said, “Well, let me ask you this. Who eats dinner first, you or Petunia?” I was like, “Petunia eats dinner first. She eats dinner at 5:00 p.m., ’cause she’s a foot long and two years old.” She said, “No, you need to eat dinner first. Because the king eats before anyone else eats.” Oh, yes, and what a mighty king I will be, eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon. “Look upon your sovereign, Petunia, and tremble. My lands stretch across this entire one bedroom, and I eat dinner whenever I choose, as long as it works for the schedule of a dog.” She said, “Now, you don’t actually have to eat dinner before Petunia. You just have to convince Petunia that you’ve already eaten.” So… for the past month, I shit you not… before my wife and I give Petunia her dish, we take down empty bowls and spoons, and in front of her, we go, “Mmm, dinner. Mmm, good dinner.” Like we’re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote, but they didn’t work that hard on. “Mmm, we’re eating dinner.” Meanwhile, Petunia’s just staring at us with her Paul Giamatti face, like… “You’re not eating dinner, cocksucker. Dish, now.” I have a wife and a dog, and we just bought a house. We have a new house. It was built in the ’20s, but it was flipped in 2014. Which means it’s haunted, but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash. Actually, we didn’t buy a house. A bank bought a house, and I’m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while I pay it off for 30 years. The woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years. And she said, “So, for instance, this is what you’ll pay in July of 2029.” And I burst out laughing. I was like, “2029? That’s not a real year. By 2029, I’ll be drinking moon juice with President Jonathan Taylor Thomas. I’m not gonna be writing you a paper check.” I like having a house, but I loved looking for a house, ’cause I love real estate agents. I mean, they are the true heroes. They really are. Have you ever watched HGTV? Real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives. Every episode of HGTV is like, “Craig and Stacia are looking for a two-story A-frame that’s near Craig’s job in the downtown, but also satisfies Stacia’s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near Craig’s job. With three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of $7… let’s see what Lori Jo can do on this week’s episode of You Don’t Deserve A Beach House.” I loved our real estate agent. It was so fun to hang out with her. It was like hanging out with my mom. ‘Cause, you know, real estate agents always look like your mom. And they have various Chico’s accoutrements. They always have kind of fun mom energy. And they’re always, “So excited to see you two.” We would have little conferences before we walked into a house. She’d go, “Let’s talk. Let’s talk before we go in.” We’re, like, two feet from the door. “So, there’s no toilets. And I know that was on your list. But I think I can get him to budge. Let’s go.” So, we’d have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent who’s just some guy sitting in a big chair. And these two always hated each other. They’d be like, “Hi, Tony.” “Hi, Kim.” It’s like, “Jesus Christ! What, were you two in the Eagles together? What is the animosity about?” Our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. She hinted about it constantly. Every room she walked into, she’d be like, “So, this could be an office.” “Or maybe a nursery.” “Yeah. No, like we said, we don’t know if we’re gonna have… ” “No, no. I know, I know, you know. You don’t know if you’re gonna have ’em, but you know. You know, you never know. Sometimes you don’t know what’s gonna happen, and then… you know, something happens.” “Well, yeah, that’s how all of life works.” “Okay, all right. Okay. Uh-huh. Mmm. This is an on-fire garbage can. Could be a nursery.” She showed me a backyard once. She goes, “I don’t even like this backyard for you.” I was like, “Oh, do tell.” She said, “It’s all pavement. I think you should have some grass out there. You know, in case you have a couple… little guys… running around in the grass.” And I got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. I was like, “Hey, lady. I went outside about as much as Powder from the movie Powder. My children are not gonna be playing out on grass. They will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. These are my children. And that’s my wife!” I didn’t mean to make it sound like we don’t want children. We don’t, but I didn’t mean to make it sound like that. See, I just don’t think babies like me very much. Sometimes babies will point at me, and I don’t care for that shit at all. Like, I’ll be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one Cheerio with Bobby Fischer-like intensity. And it’ll look up at me and go… I like to lean in and go, “Stop snitchin’, motherfucker.” And then walk off. ‘Cause you’re never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. My friends have babies and I don’t do so well with them. I had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. I know there are better ways to start that story, but… My friend, Jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and I really like her. She’s a sweet kid. I really like his daughter a lot. But I was over at his family’s house for the Fourth of July, and he had his daughter on his knee. And it was a very lovely day. His whole extended family was there. And he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, “Do you know who that is? That’s your Uncle John.” And I was like, “Oh, my God. That’s so sweet. I’m her Uncle John.” And then the baby pointed at me and said, “Uncle John has a penis.” I thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! Fell deadly silent, is what they all did. Hey, do you know what you’re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, “He has a penis”? No, I’m asking, ’cause I don’t know what to say in that situation. Here’s what I went with that day. I said, “Oh, come on!” I don’t know. I thought that’d be good. But then it just made it worse, ’cause it sounded like the baby and I had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. Like, the baby had been like, “Do you have a penis?” And I was like, “Yes, I do, but you’re a baby, so discretion is key.” And then the next day she goes, “He has a penis,” and I go, “Oh, come on! Someone can’t keep a secret!” Luckily, Jeremy’s wife saved the day. The baby’s mom saved the day. She came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, “It’s okay. She’s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot.” Aren’t we all? And, by the way, it would’ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. Like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, “She has a vagina,” the woman could be like, “Yes, I do, and it’s magnificent.” And we would all be like, “Hooray! You are brave!” No one wants to applaud the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo. It’s fun to be married. I’ve never been supervised before. I’m supervised. She studies what I do. Like an anthropologist. She’ll be like, “Sometimes, he will watch a movie on TV even though he already owns that movie on DVD. Pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him.” I had no supervision when I was a kid. We were free to do what we wanted. But also, with that, no one cared about kids. I grew up before children were special. I did. Very early ’80s, right before children became special. Like, I remember when milk carton kids became a thing. When they were like, “Hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. I don’t think they’re just blowing off steam.” No one cared about my opinion when I was a little kid. No one cared what I thought. Sometimes, people would say, “What do you think you’re doing?” But that just meant “Stop.” They didn’t actually wanna know my thought process. They didn’t want me to be like, “Well, I was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when I lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere.” “Oh, well, that’s very interesting. And what brought you to this experiment?” “Oh, well, thank you for asking. Well… you know how I’m filled with rage? I’m so horny and angry all the time… and I have no outlet for it. So… eggs.” Your opinion doesn’t matter in elementary school either. It matters in college. College is just your opinion. Just you raising your hand and being like, “I think Emily Dickinson’s a lesbian.” And they’re like, “Partial credit.” And that’s a whole thing. But in elementary school, it doesn’t matter what you think, it just matters what you know. You have to have answers to questions. And if you say, “I don’t know,” you get an X on your test, and you get it wrong and that’s not fair, ’cause your brain has never been smaller. Also, that’s not how life works. I’m in my 30s now. If you came to me now and you were like, “Hey, John, name three things that the Stamp Act of 1775 accomplished.” I’d go, “I don’t know. Get out of my apartment,” you know? But when you’re a little kid, you can’t say, “I don’t know.” You should be able to. That should be an acceptable answer on a test. You should be able to write in, “I don’t know. I know you told me. But I have had a very long day. I am very small. And I have no money. So you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under.” Or if it’s one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, “Who’s to say?” Kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. Like, that’s the biggest civil rights increase I’ve seen in my lifetime. The rights of children have gone through the roof. I had no rights when I was a little kid. I remember, one time, I walked into a supermarket by myself, and I walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, “No!” And I went, “All right.” And I turned around and left. That’s how broken I was. And there weren’t special things for kids the way there are now. Like, we would just go see movies. Any movie. Like Back to the Future. That was a movie everyone could see. Kids could kinda see it. Great movie, right? I rewatched it recently. It’s a very weird movie. Marty McFly is a 17-year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. And, I shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. They never explain it. Not even in a lazy way, like, “Hey, remember when we met in the science building?” They don’t even do that. And we were all fine with it. We were just like, “What, who’s his best friend? A disgraced nuclear physicist? All right, proceed.” What a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. Two guys had to go in and do that. They had to be like, “Okay… we got an idea… for the next big family-action-comedy. All right, it’s about a guy named Marty, and he’s very lazy. He’s always sleeping late.” “Okay. Is he cool like Ferris Bueller?” “No. But he does have this best friend who’s, you know, a disgraced… nuclear physicist.” “I’m confused here. This best friend, this is another student?” “No, no, no. No, this guy’s either, like, 40 or 80. Even we don’t know how old this guy’s supposed to be. But one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. Whoa!” “Okay. I think I see where you’re going here. They build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the Kennedy assassination.” “Ah! Oh, wow, that’s a really good idea, I mean, we didn’t even think of that.” “All right, well, what do they do with the time machine?” “Well, now I’m embarrassed to say. Ah, well, all right, all right, all right. We thought… We thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom.” “I don’t know. We thought that’d be fun for people. But, no, good point. No, he doesn’t get to, he doesn’t get to. ‘Cause this family friend named Biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. The dad’s gotta beat the rapist off of her. And also, we’re gonna imply that a white man wrote ‘Johnny B. Goode.’ So, we’re gonna take that away from ’em.” “Well, this is the best movie idea I have ever heard in my life. We’re gonna make three of them. Now, you say they go to the past. How about we call it Back to the Past?” “No, no, no. Back to the Future.” “Right, but they go to the past.” “Yeah.” Kids have it very good now. My friend’s a teacher. She told me that, uh… the parents will take the kids’ side over the teacher now. That’s insane. That never happened. My parents trusted every grown-up… more than they trusted me. I don’t mean coaches and teachers. Any human adult’s word… was better than mine. Any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, “Excuse me! Your kid bit my dick.” And my mom would be like, “John Edmund Mulaney, did you bite this nice man’s dick?” And I would be the only one who’s like, “Hey, doesn’t anyone wanna know why… his dick was near my biters… in the first place? Isn’t anyone curious… as to how I had access?” Don’t get me wrong, my parents love us. They just didn’t like us. We weren’t friends. People are now like, “My mom’s my best friend.” I was like, “Oh, is she a super bad mom?” My parents didn’t trust us, and they shouldn’t have trusted us. We were little goblins. We were terrible. I remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. Three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, “All right, we’re going to a resort, and I’ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm.” And we were like, “Oh, yes! Yay! Yes!” “Now, I’m telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm.” “Oh, we’re gonna freak out so bad!” “Yes, John, you have a question?” “How did he lose his arm?” “That’s exactly what you won’t ask.” And then I did ask. I went into the kitchen one day, and I was like, “So, how’d you lose your arm?” And he was like, “Well, I was born with only one arm.” And I was like, “Nah.” No, my parents loved us. It’s just, like, they were the cops, you know? And we were criminals. So, we didn’t get along. We only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. Like, when my dad and I would talk, it was like that scene in the movie Heat, when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino sit down in that diner. We kind of had that rapport of, like, “Hmm, we’re not so different, you and I. You have your law practice, and me, I have all these fucking markers.” “I guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way.” My dad would respect it if I could get away with breaking a rule. We had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch TV on a school night. So, every school night, I would 100% be watching TV. And I would hear my dad coming, I would immediately turn the TV off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. And I’d open it and pretend to be doing homework. My dad would walk in the room and he would go, “What are you doing? Are you watching TV?” And I’d go, “No, man. I’m not watching TV.” And the TV wouldn’t even be dark yet. It would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. It’d be sizzling like a glass of Pepsi. And I would look my dad in the eyes and go, “No, I’m just reading this Yellow Pages.” My dad loved us. He just didn’t care about our general happiness or self-esteem. I remember, one time, we were really little kids. I have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to Wisconsin. My dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. ‘Cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? You remember that era? Where we were like, “How much wood can we get on this car… without it catching on fire?” But then the big announcement. “We here at Plymouth-Chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times you’ve looked at your minivan and thought, ‘Huh! It needs a belt.'” So, we’re going on the highway. We’ve been on the road for three hours. And in the distance, we see a McDonald’s. We see the golden arches. And we got so excited. We started chanting, “McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s!” And my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. And then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. And kept driving. And, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. How perfect is that? He had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. The one thing from McDonald’s no child could enjoy. My dad is cold-blooded. He once shushed a kid during Lion King on Broadway. That actually happened. We were at Lion King on Broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, “Look, it’s Pumbaa! Look, it’s Timon!” And my dad turned around and said, “Are you going to talk the entire time?” He’s my hero. The weirdest thing when I was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. They scared us about it constantly. And I’ve been on tour this year… Marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another. It’s insane. Yeah, well… All right, don’t “whoo” if you’re white. It’s always been legal for us. Come on, sir. We don’t go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy. When I was arrested with a one-hitter at a Rusted Root concert, I did not serve hard time. I think I got an award. Eighteen or 19 states. And, by the way, I agree, it’s a very good thing. But it’s also a really weird thing, because this is the first time I’ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like, “Fine.” You know? I’ve never seen it before. Like, gay marriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the Supreme Court, and be like, “Gay people are humans.” And they’re like, “We’ll think about it.” But with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for 40 years, like, “Excuse me.” And then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and they’re just like, “Okay, here. Take a little. We’d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else… blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.” Those stupid parents. And that’s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. It would be on our sitcoms. We’d be watching Saved by the Bell, we’d be having a great old time. And then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. And they’d always hold the joint… The bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. They’d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. Like it’s a skull in a Shakespeare play. And now it’s legal, and that is great news. Unless you’re a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. And I don’t just mean because they’re about to lose out to Amazon.com. I more feel bad for weed dealers ’cause they’re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. And we don’t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. Like, when the Chinese food delivery guy comes, we don’t let him hang out after he’s delivered the Chinese food. And we don’t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we’re hanging out with… to try to preserve the relationship. And we definitely don’t give him some of the Chinese food. He’s never like, “Hey, can I get in on those dumplings?” And we’re like, “Yeah, we’re all friends.” What are you, on your phone? Hey, V-neck. Hey! – What’s your name? – Sam. Sam? Cool! What do you do to afford V-necks, Sam? Typing numbers. Ah… numbers, the letters of math. I’m sorry to bother you. I don’t mean to single you out. I hate when people get pulled out of the audience. Like, are you familiar with the Cirque du Soleil, Sam? They’re a group of French assholes that are slowly taking over America by humiliating audience members one by one. We once went to see Cirque du Soleil at Navy Pier when I was a kid, and my brother came, and he was 12 years old. You remember being 12, when you’re like, “No one look at me or I’ll kill myself.” And these French bastards come into the crowd, being like, “Le volunteer!” And they pulled my brother up on stage, and I was like, “No!” And they brought him up, and they reached into his sweatshirt, and they were like… And they had planted a bra, and they pulled out a bra and they were like… And everyone at Navy Pier was like “Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!” And my brother was like, “That’s great!” I have had other jobs besides comedy. I was an office temp for a while. I really miss that. I loved being a temp, because I would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week. And then you just get to retire like Lou Gehrig. You’re like, “Thank you. No one will ever see me again.” And they’re like, “Goodbye!” I worked at an office once on 57th Street in New York City. I was there for a couple weeks. I was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. This woman named Mischa sat in the other cubicle. I want to get the number right. I think Mischa had… about 900,000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. Almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, A Beautiful Mind-style. I think about Mischa two times a week… because of a phone call she had next to me one day. It was one of my first days, and I was sitting next to her. And her phone rang, and this was her call, and I’m quoting. Her phone rang and she said, “Hello? Hush!” And then she hung up. Think about that two times a week. And I didn’t know her well enough by then to be like, “Hey, what kind of a person are you?” You know? Who could she have been talking to? “Hello? Hush!” This was a place of business. My only thought was that it was the CEO of the company being like, “Mischa, help. I’m doing a crossword puzzle. I need a four-letter word for ‘be quiet’ right now.” – “Hush!” – “You’re promoted.” I temped at a little web company on 25th Street in New York City. It was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money New York. His name was Henry J. Finch IV. Like old, old, old money. Like, his money was in molasses or something. He owned this web company. I have no idea why he owned this web company. I think he won it in a rich man’s game of dice and small binoculars, or something. Mr. Finch wore linen suits. He had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. I’m giving you more description than you need, ’cause I need you to believe me. This was a real person I knew in the 21st century. Mr. Finch was in his 70s. He had an assistant named Mary. She was in her 50s, she was Korean. I don’t know why he had an assistant. He did not need one. Unless he needed someone to be like, “Remember, Mr. Finch, at five o’clock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled egg.” One day, Mr. Finch came into the office. It had been raining. Everything I’m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. Mr. Finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. And he walked in and he said, and I’m quoting, “Ah! One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” And then Mary yelled, “Ooh, ducklings!” To which Mr. Finch replied, “Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack.” And then walked into his office. I think about that every goddamn day. I mean, imagine you’re me. You’re a 22-year-old temp, and you’re so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. And then that happens in front of you, and I don’t know, gives you hope? And I did that a little fast. Let me break that conversation down for you. Mr. Finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. “Ah!” “One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!” The rain. “And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” Now, that’s debatable. But rather than debate that point, Mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point… which was, “Ducklings!” But Mr. Finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality… said, “Ah, too old to be a duckling!” As if to say, “My duckling days are behind me. Mary, don’t you see? I’m a duck now. And to prove it… Well, I’ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has… ‘Quack, quack.'” And I knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to Mr. Finch, what he had said. Crazy people are like that. They have unlimited crazy currency. Like, if I had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, “Hey, Finch, you remember that time you were like, ‘Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack’?” He would just be like, “Ah, perhaps I did quack! But such is life for an old knickerbocker like me.” Like, he’d say something else crazy. That’s the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? Is that they just have unlimited currency. The things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. I was once walking into Penn Station in New York. I was walking down 31st Street towards Eighth Avenue. I’m walking down 31st, there’s this woman standing at Eighth and 31st. I have my little roller suitcase. You can all imagine. I’m walking towards her. She’s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. She’s watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had Terminator vision… where she could see little bits of data, like, “Little honky ass,” and could read information. As I walked past her, she said this to me. I walked past her and she said, and I’m quoting, “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” Very dirty, yes? A very upsetting thing to hear, yes? I’m sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. I was alone out there that afternoon. And she said this totally unprompted. “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” It wasn’t like I had paused in front of her and been like, “What should I do with my life?” So, I walk away from her with this to-do list. And I like structure, I like a to-do list. It did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. ‘Cause it starts in a pretty rough place. It starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. But by the end, you have your own small business. And isn’t that the American dream when all’s said and done? That if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. Imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, “But I…” This has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. I just wanna say that in all sincerity. Thanks for coming to this. Really, really appreciate it. I wanna tell you one more story before I get out of here, about the night I met a guy named Bill Clinton. Now, I don’t… Some of you know who that is? For those of you that don’t, he was President of the United States from 1993 until 2001, and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared Emperor of the United States of America. Now, I know you know who Bill Clinton is. But I was doing a show at a college, and I mentioned Bill Clinton, and, like, they kind of didn’t know who he was. Like, sorry, they knew the name, right? But they only knew this 2015 Bill Clinton, who’s a very different Bill Clinton. Have you seen his ass lately? What the hell is he trying to pull? He’s all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and he’s got these grandpa reading glasses, like, “Hey, I can’t do nothing to nobody no more.” “Oh, me? I’m just an old, old man. I don’t have the appetites.” You know? And he’s always flying around the world with Bill Gates trying to cure AIDS. That is not the Bill Clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago. Our Bill Clinton was like a big, fat Buddy Garrity from Friday Night Lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on Arsenio, and his work in the STD community was not in curing anything at that time. That was the man we all elected president. That was the Bill Clinton that I met. I got to meet Bill Clinton when he was Governor Clinton in 1992, when he was first running for president. And I got to meet Bill Clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as Bill Clinton. They’re a little younger, but they went to the same college. So, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. Now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. One, I got to meet Bill Clinton. But two, I got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. And that is super funny to see, ’cause think about some of the people you went to school with. Now imagine they’re becoming the president. Imagine Sam was becoming the president. It would stir up strong emotions. And my parents had very different opinions on Bill Clinton. My mom loved Bill Clinton, ’cause Bill Clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. I mean, think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like Frank Caliendo doing John Madden. Now… imagine him as a college student. And my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. That sounds good, right? So, my mom tells me that Bill Clinton would be out in front of the library every single night… just being like, “Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home?” And one night, my mom was leaving the library, and Bill Clinton was like, “Hey, can I walk ya home?” And my mom was like, “Hell, yes.” So… This is absolutely true. My mom, little Ellen Stanton, walked arm-in-arm with Bill Clinton to her dorm. And she was like, “You know, I wanted to invite him up for a beer.” And I was like, “Thanks, I’m nine.” But… her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with Bill Clinton. Now, my dad, on the other hand, hated Bill Clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. And also, my dad’s a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. He always told me that he hated it in college that Bill Clinton could, quote, “Get away with anything.” Can you imagine how he felt later? So, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet Bill Clinton. My mom opens it first and she goes, “Oh, we have to go. We have to go see Bill.” And without looking up at her, my dad just says, “Why? It’s not like he’s gonna remember you.” One black coffee. Same motherfucker. So, my mom says, “Fine! I’ll go and I’ll take John.” And I was like, “Hell, yeah.” And I slid in the room in my First Communion suit, ready to go. ‘Cause I loved Bill Clinton. I was ten years old. If you were a kid when Bill Clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. We’d never seen a cool politician before. And he would go on MTV, and he’d have cool answers to kids’ questions. They’d be like, “Governor, what’s your favorite food?” And he’d be like, “I don’t know, fries?” And we’d be like, “Yay, we eat fries!” I learned to play his campaign song on the piano. It was “Don’t Stop” by Fleetwood Mac… from Rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. He let us know who he was right away. So, I went with my mom, as her date… to reconnect with Governor Bill Clinton. We walked into the ballroom. It was a big hotel ballroom. It was the Palmer House Hilton, big Hilton hotel ballroom. Walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. It’s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie The Fugitive, remember? So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people, the… Sorry, the end where Harrison Ford, as Dr. Richard Kimble, bursts in to confront Dr. Charles Nichols, right? Okay. So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people. Why does Kimble confront Nichols? Well, I know we all know this, but… No, no. But, but, but… Kimble, he found out that Nichols, along with Devlin MacGregor and Lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired Frederick Sykes, the one-armed man, to kill Kimble. Kimble’s wife wasn’t even the target. I know we all know this. But they were gonna kill Kimble because he wasn’t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass RUD-90. So, Kimble finds out about all of this, and, of course, he’s furious. And he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, “You switched the samples!” And Dr. Nichols is like, “Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, Dr. Richard Kimble.” What accent did that guy have, by the way? He goes, “You switched the samples! And you doctored your research! So that you could have Provasic!” Anyway, so it’s that ballroom. So, we walk into that ballroom. It was packed with people. It was packed with people. A real Who’s Not of Chicago celebrities. Walter Jacobson was there. Walter Jacobson was the local Fox anchor. He’d do fun things where he’d go undercover as a homeless person. And he’d be like, “Oh, what time is the soup?” And they’d be like, “Man, you’re Walter Jacobson.” He was there. Everybody. And on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we saw a little bit of silver hair. And it was him… Bill Clinton. The Comeback Kid. But he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and Secret Service. So, what are you gonna do? Well, if you’re my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. And then you start jogging while yelling, “This ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the United States!” Kind of implying that I might be dying. My feet were not on the ground. She was swinging me like a snowplow. I was just mowing down fat Chicago Democrats. I pushed past all the reporters, I pushed past all the photographers. We pushed past all the Secret Service. We land at Bill Clinton’s feet. Bill Clinton turns, looks at my mom and says, “Hey, Ellen,” ’cause he never forgets a bitch, ever. My mom melts. She goes, “Hi, Bill.” Then it is revealed that she has no plan. So… she pushes me towards Clinton and she goes, “This is my son, John, and he’s also going to be president.” And I was like, “What the hell are you talking about? I’m not gonna be president.” And I know now that I’m definitely never gonna be president. Not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. Based on my ten-year-old memory, Bill Clinton is about 13 feet tall. And he leaned down, because, well, I was wearing this button that I bought outside the fundraiser. It was a cartoon button of George H. W. Bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. And it said, “Bird-brained.” And I thought it was very funny. And Bill Clinton leaned down so that only I could hear and he said, “Hey, man, I like your button.” And I said, “You can do whatever you want forever.” And he took my advice. And… it was the best night of my entire life. And I got home that night… I got home that night, and my dad was still awake, like, reading angry under one lamp, just like… And I went up to him and I went, “Hey! I’m gonna be a Democrat.” “And I’m gonna vote for Bill Clinton.” And without looking up at me, my dad just said, “You have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair.” You know, how you talk to a child. So, here’s the end of that story. That was 1992. Let’s flash forward five years to 1997. It is now 1997. I am a sophomore in high school, Bill Clinton is in his second term as president. And on the morning that the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of The New York Times. It had been on the Drudge Report, and then it was on the cover of The New York Times. That morning, I wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. I am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach. And I open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work, and he says, “The other shoe just dropped.” And then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend Bill Clinton.

woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and uh hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was like oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was like oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was like all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had like we had we had so much chemistry he was like hey wassup i was like wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was like hey can you drop me off i was like where he was like at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was like oh no i just fucked a homeless dude again my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who like you know wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they like to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it you know because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude you know you feel like youre in a wes anderson movie or something and you know white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff like that and its very you know its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel like im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement you know just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im like i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer you know but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you like you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on you know my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was like hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its like making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just like a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night you know oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre like i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more like loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell like responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding uh between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things like host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse uh you know learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up like filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was like its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was like its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total like private school asians we both are big hippies too we like to backpack through southeast asia we like to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit like that uh we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes like freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats like a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of asian people like we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were like oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so you know i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because you know that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre like im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always like oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013 like you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and like very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be like we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre like but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be like look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im like that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retired i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day like youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically like wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre like oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks like its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to you know squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want you know its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was like you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently um and he was like hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was like why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes like mrs pacman just lets redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was like uh youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really you know freaked out about anal and theyre like oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel like youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt like i got a second chance at life you know i was like oh my god its like im going back in time \\u266a a whole new world \\u266a it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah like a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your\\u2013 just give your man a little\\u2013 a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari you know and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont\\u2013 no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they like it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i like that fear that shit turns me on you know especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye like hes discovered nirvana and its like youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim you know my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when\\u2013 when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right you know i respect you right im like yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their\\u2013 glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control you know like i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live you know i just wanna be out of control for once just\\u2013 just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cunt im just waiting for the right moment to like become a housewife financially you know i want my husband to get us to like a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people thats the kind of income bracket im striving for thats when you know youve made it when youre eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple you know what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking like a princess i have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be like guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are like thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me you know a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were like ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was like yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won you know another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were like why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was like yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed like a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and you know why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were like yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im like oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here you know i need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre like im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are like the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because uh im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me like im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbusters i dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b like skittles so my uterus probably looked like a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act like everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich uh mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were like oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was like only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be like were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its like release the kraken and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship you know and um yeah and most of the time like we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be like ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look like they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be like hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymore im very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre like oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was like uh yeah where im from thats like losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was like no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was like yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was like you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted im scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula you know what that is you know what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did you know that youre gonna poop on the table i was like yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense like that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channel i can already see how theres like this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommy you know i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i like i berate my husband on like a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant you know your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see like a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then you know they get big\\u2013 they get big like fingers like you you you owe me money you my nipples look like whoppers now and naked i look like a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not like when i was  years old when it was like really hot you know and i was like why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporin so you know i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos like way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and uh two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnant all right ive been ali wong have a good night

challenger you guys remember that right i think its funny i think its funny how the things that happen to us when were kids end up staying with us for our entire lives i got this little niece when she was three years old she almost drowned and now to this day even ten years later she still will not go anywhere near me yeah i was babysitting her and trying to do laundry and she accidentally fell into the washing machine thought i was quick i got good reflexes i thought i got her out before anyone would find out what happened but nope turned everything pink youre gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one hey did you guys know did you guys know that when a newborn baby when a newborn baby is first born when its fresh out of the womb it can actually hear and see everything around it for up to ten seconds after its decapitated yeah yeah i never know what to say i never know what to say to someone after theyve lost a baby what do you say to someone after theyve lost a baby oh im sorry for your loss doesnt cut it are you gonna be okay not even close thats why i just keep my mouth shut let my lawyer do the talking im not good with kids thats my point thats what this whole things about im not good with kids not gonna lie hell a couple of months ago i dropped my cousins baby flatout dropped my cousins baby on the ground but i dont feel like that was my fault i dont feel responsible for that one you know who in their right mind who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me anthony jeselnik to be a pallbearer its okay people hate people hate dead baby jokes they hate them they hate them its like anthony why do you have to tell dead baby jokes why do you have so many dead baby jokes no one likes them why do you insist well ill tell you why because dead baby jokes have made me rich and who was it who was it who said the first million is the hardest was it hitler didnt see that one coming did you that was a good response most audiences just pretend i didnt say it but i like it i like making hitler jokes its cool for me i enjoy it hell i lost my grandfather i lost my grandfather in the holocaust museum it was the holocaust museum of modern art which is just like a normal holocaust museum except you walk around all day being like oh i should have thought of that my grandmother died about a year ago and i didnt think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away but i was wrong it was fine the hard part the upsetting part was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted she wanted to die in the best way possible like uh you radio winner whats the best way you can die this is not a trick question \\u2013 in your sleep \\u2013 yes thank you thank you everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep not me i want to be alert awake surrounded by friends in a house fire but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep we thought thats how she went we were all excited for her but then we did an autopsy found out she actually died horribly in the worst way possible during an autopsy it was fucked up yeah yeah she always said her grandkids didnt pay enough attention to her and and she was right she was dead on but i loved my grandma loved her very much my grandma taught me about a lot taught me what religion is taught me everything you can know about religion in one quick story ill tell you now when i graduated from high school when i graduated my grandma came to me gave me a big hug said anthony im so proud of you youre my first grandchild to get to go to college what can i do for you what can i give you before you go to college and i said honestly grandma all i need from you is money yeah i know you guys have never been but college is expensive and my grandma said okay anthony i understand couple months go by its the end of summer im packing up my dads car getting ready to go to school and my grandma walks up says anthony here before you leave take this and she handed me a brandnew bible king james version and i said thanks grandma thats exactly what we talked about i got in the car and i went off to school couple of weeks go by im hanging out in my dorm room having a good time when the phone rings its my grandma anthony just calling to see how college is going grandma college is the best im having the time of my life but to be honest im starting to run low on money and i could use a little bit like we talked about she said okay well let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said totally grandma im on chapter four she said okay anthony i guess ill talk to you later hung up the phone couple of months go by now im really starting to struggle financially might have to drop out of school so i call my grandma in a panic i say please its anthony im having the time of my life in college but if i wanna graduate and i do i need you to send me some money like we talked about she said anthony let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said yes grandma i wish it was longer and she said okay anthony i guess ill talk to you later finally its the end of the school year ive got straight as but im dropping out of college cause i have no more money left and im furious close to tears cleaning out my dorm room when the phone rings its my grandma anthony i heard youre dropping out of school today how come and i said you know goddamn well how come grandma cause you wouldnt give me any money she said anthony let me ask you this did you read your bible and i just hung up the phone i was so pissed off took everything out of that room last thing i took off the shelf the last thing i took out of that room was that bible my grandma had given me took it off the shelf held it in my hands and for the first time i actually opened it up and on the very first page in my grandmothers handwriting it said fuck you thank you everyone i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight and all the jokes i write theyre all made up theyre all fake except for eric clapton and the challenger everything else everything else is fake but everything im about to tell you from here until the end of the show thats all true now i dont tell dark jokes because im a comedian im a comedian because i tell dark jokes im kind of fucked up all right ive always been this way i cant really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends its ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyones funeral i asked a friend for advice was like ive never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and dont tell a joke try not to so i walked up and was like you know what my favorite memory was when i was like four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it like mark twain out of my grandmas mouth it would just come to life and then i couldnt help myself i said and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the n word now i promise you i promise you until youve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wifes funeral at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think im one of the best comedians of all time but heres the thing it doesnt matter if you believe me it really doesnt matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i like to test myself i like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i dont believe in too soon im on a tight schedule and im good at it im good at it like the day of the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted other than that how was the movie right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that the reason i get away with stuff like that is im just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didnt make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i dont follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying dont do it and whenever i see that whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad cause i know something horrible has happened people will say anthony whats funny about aurora whats funny about the boston marathon whats funny about your grandmothers funeral nothing nothing is funny about those things thats where i come in so i see these texts and im like oh no what happened but i also think ive got a job to do so i go online i start reading about it i dont want to watch the footage but ill read about what happened and i think how can i make someone laugh today and then i think i got it i go back on twitter and i tweet guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed especially the finish line and again i think nailed it usa usa but then my phone starts to ring and its my boss or should i say my former boss and they say anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today youre also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or youre fired and i say go fuck yourselves and i meant it i didnt get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because im dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said sure they said well anthony you dont understand you dont understand at all if you dont take this joke down right now if you dont delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people theyre also out of a job and im ashamed to tell you this im embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke cause im happy to fight for what i believe in im happy to take the consequences for what ive done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet couldnt do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now ill tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in im just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture theyre like anthony were family why are you so upset cant you see we did you a favor dont you worry about your career let me ask you san francisco do i seem like i worry about my career no you know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if theyre worried about their money they wouldnt have played the lottery in the first fuckin place i do not worry about my career and they said anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems like youre making fun of the victims and thats wrong but thats not what im doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell me im wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking hey are we trending no this is who im making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston do you know what thats worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying dont forget about me today dont forget about me lots of crazy distractions in the news but dont forget how sad i am those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of theyre like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understand now im sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it its fine its embarrassing but its fun you can laugh at yourself its not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me thats fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess thats what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called shark party all right now some of you enjoyed it but if youve never seen shark party you can never see shark party its been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year  million sharks are killed by human beings every year   people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack im like fuck yeah win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say you know what i want to have a shark party as soon as theres a shark attack were having a shark party and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do ive already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark its time for a shark party lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing ive ever said on television smile you son of a bitch shark party and in america where im famous for those types of shenanigans everybody was like anthony that was fucked up it was fucked up to see you dance end of controversy however in new zealand where they dont get my show theyve never seen me and frankly they dont get out much the new zealand media takes the video and they show it to the guys family and they say what do you guys think about this and they say crikey or whatever the fuck they say over there the point is all of new zealand all of new zealand rises up against me all  of those cunts rise up and start threatening my life now i dont read the things that people write about me on the internet but i pay people who do and they come to me and theyre like weve got some terrible news please sit down they say you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of shark party and i was like really new zealand wants to kill me thats weird because they didnt even kill the shark i said how many death threats am i getting and they were like oh all of them you are getting all of the death threats what do you want us to do we can send someone to talk to them extra security what do you want i said no forget about it leave it alone dont worry this might be hard for some to understand ive said it several times tonight everyone is going to die i know full well i am going to die and most of us dont get to choose how we check out but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes best case scenario if somebody murders me over one of my jokes i immediately become a legend im a comedy god the mount rushmore of comedy is me four times i said come on then my security guys are like okay anthony well just so you know that is the dumbest thing weve ever heard but youre the boss okay and they leave and then the next day they come back and they say anthony sorry to bother you again i know you didnt care yesterday but its gotten much worse youre gonna wanna hear this they say someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dads phone number and address in pittsburgh posted that online and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand and i have to admit that had never occurred to me before it never crossed my mind that my family my loved ones would ever pay the price be caught in harms way for something ive done or ive joked about and honestly i would cut my throat for my jokes i would give my life for what i do but if anyone and i mean this for a fact if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke ive made even better this man is fantastici watched the show  times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable  great material so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is okay but a joke about a famous musicians son falling to his death isnt  where are your priorities theyre just jokes  its just syllables formed together  theyre just words people are monsters these are just words your email address will not be published required fields are marked  name email website

times\",\n          \"    ladies and gentlemen make some noise for ronny chieng     thank you thank you hawaii im turning  so im harvesting my wifes eggs this year im harvesting my wifes eggs so that we can make embryos so we can freeze the embryos so that we do not have to have kids right now because kids are what you have when youve given up on your own hopes and dreams  im still trying here i look at my friends who are my age who have kids and they all look like shit  its gotten to the point where i cant even take a photo with them and post it on my main grid because it messes up the aesthetics of my instagram too much with their fucking haggard faces just drooping wrinkly crowsfeetembedded heads receding hairlines just withering graying hair coming out in clumps because of their children like i did a show and someone i went to high school with in singapore came to the show and after the show i met up with them and they brought another person with them and i was like oh is this other person your mom thank you so much for bringing your mother to my show and that other person was also someone i went to high school with  thats how fucking ugly  these people have become because of their children just unrecognizable so im trying to use money and science to push the curve back a little bit and um first step of harvesting my wifes eggs is i have to inject my wife twice a day for two weeks so i have to inject my wife i am the one injecting my wife twice a day for two weeks zero medical training i was given no medical training whatsoever the government lets you do this the the doctor asked me to do it the doctor was like hey have you ever held a needle before no perfect here take this and inject your wife in the middle of her body like nicolas cage in the rock  twice a day for two weeks with chemicals that we mail to you mystery chemicals that we send to your house in unmarked brown boxes just trust us that its the right thing that youre injecting into the person you love the most internet chemicals that show up it comes in a powder i have to make it into a liquid you understand its a meth lab in my kitchen as im mixing the comp im sweating the whole time cause im scared ill fuck up the measurements and kill my wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely then you have to like the air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements and then you have to put it in the syringe then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude like you know what youre doing   i dont know what im doing i saw someone do this on doogie howser   i dont even know the angle to put it into her  like it looks so painful going in like i love my wife so much i cant even bear to watch her in pain i couldnt even bear to watch the needle go into her i had to inject my wife like this i had to like cover my eyes and like backhand it  into her like kurosawa  did i get the middle of your body no okay just walk into the needle  im supposed to do all the work here meet me halfway and uh the doctor said if you do everything right if you measure correctly you inject at the right times they scan like this part of her body you know that chicago bulls logo right and they were like  if you do everything right based on what we can tell you should expect  eggs  and my wife ended up getting   yeah always a  yeah always like a late halfhearted response to  usually the women in the crowd are like whoo yeah all the men in the crowd are always like  is that a good number is  a good number of eggs how many eggs equal one bebe is it four eggs is one bebe so  eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together let me put this in a language that men can understand okay twentysix eggs from one vagina in one cycle is mvp numbers  twentysix eggs is like if magic johnson averaged the tripledouble and killed his own aids  okay thats the level of medical miracle thats happening in whatever this part of my wifes body that horn of the bull that like curls into itself the doctor like scraped out  eggs out of my wifes vagina like salmon roe just scooping out just dripping out and then you put it in some nigiri right and then you eat it thats how babies are made you gotta salt bae the eggs onto the ikura and then you eat it so uh were trying to make embryos so eggs thats just half the equation i dont know if you know how embryos are made but eggs thats just half of it she did her part admirably so now i have to contribute my half of the embryo equation so im sitting in the doctors office  like a wet pigeon all right and the doctor comes over and the doctors a woman because of course she is shes like good morning mr chieng so um whens the last time you ejaculated my wife is right here and shes like yeah when is the last time you ejaculated  we would all like to know its the one time in life where youre not allowed to lie about jerking off its when a medical professional is asking you a direct question and its for reproduction its for the intended purpose so you gotta tell the truth so im like whatever ill tell the truth uh let me check my calendar uh  i guess the last time i ejaculated was um let me see uh yesterday around  pm  and my wife is like yesterday i was with you all day  and i was like yeah but remember when you took out the trash   because i also put up mvp numbers against a shot clock and heavy defensive pressure but i was thinking of you the whole time its really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever vietnamese people eat my wife is vietnamese ive no idea what the fuck she eats n\\u01b0\\u1edbc m\\u1eafm  and i went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off its the medical jerkingoff room every hospital has a medical jerkingoff room okay its nondescript not a lot of signage smaller than i think it should be lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt and im sitting in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and theres grown men outside the door waiting for me to finish  so they too can use the medical jerkingoff room that we are sharing like a wework  and im in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and i couldnt go okay sorry sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand im sorry sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me sorry sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters as they code to death painfully and the families crying in the waiting room wasnt turning me on  so i couldnt go i couldnt go so i just call  right im like   im like these people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room uh i call the doctor back in and im like doc i cant go okay i cant medically ejaculate under these circumstances the vibes are off let me go home let me go home to medically ejaculate can i do that and the doctors like yeah you can go home but you know as soon as it comes out of your body it expires quicker than avocados in hawaii alright youve got  you have like a  window before theres like an exponential decreasing probability of  im like okay fine ill go home ill medically ejaculate ill come back in  minutes no problem so i go home open the front door ejaculate immediately alright this is  alright this is home court advantage i know where everything is i know whats behind me i look at the dripping garbage bag  its like a pavlovian response at this point um i ejaculate into a cup okay its a cup that they gave me its not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen  that says worlds best dad on it  its the cup that they use doctors give you to test your pee for drugs its got a really tight cap right so i ejaculate into the cup it keeps overflowing so i gotta keep like pouring it out  just overwhelming amounts  its like ghostbusters  up in here   i fill it to the brim and then i scrape off the top and then i and then i seal the cap as tight as i can right get it really nice and tight and then i i put it inside my tshirt next to my skin under my armpit nice and snug because the doctor told me to do that because apparently like the titanic your body heat will keep your people alive and then i run downstairs and i jump into a new york city taxi and im like take me to langone hospital please hurry up the taxi driver is like what the fuck are you doing with your hand are you okay im like oh yeah no im fine no its not me its my my wife shes wait a person its my jizz  and new york city taxis have seen much worse so the taxi driver was like oh okay cool thank you for using a cup  unlike the last two dudes who were back there just raw dogging at the jfk you know what im saying and uh we get to the we get to the hospital right i open the taxi door i run into the hospital and because its new york city someone on the sidewalk is like hey yo hey yo were you that guy in shangchi  am i yes i was a minor character in the marvel movie shangchi not the main guy and the guys like yo yo can i get a photo with you and im like okay sure  so we take a photo like this so someone on the internet has a photo of me and this stranger and im doing this like napoleon if you ever come across this photo just know i am holding my own jizz  so feel free to tag it  he was very grateful he was like aw thanks so much man and i was like no problem man i shake his hand right  because i love meeting my fans and i run into the hospital right already hitting the  mark end of the fourth quarter theres no time left on the clock so i just take my jizz and i just throw a buzzerbeater right the doctor like catches my jizz like  like odell beckham she just like one hand grabs it and like in the same motion without even putting it down she like alleyoops my jizz into my wifes eggs right just takes it and she goes boom shakalaka and uh my sperm goes into my wifes eggs and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg nobody knows its a mystery its a mystery of the universe nobody knows when sperm goes into the egg its unknowable ooh its its like the event horizon on a black hole no one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes nothing happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes it becomes a bubble tea  nobody knows where bubble tea comes from its tapioca the sperm goes into the egg and then you shake it and you go to vegas you throw it on the crap table and if youre lucky if you get a good dice roll right it becomes a blastocyst thats what we call future humans blastocysts it becomes embryos the doctor shell take all the embryos and shell look at them under the microscope and shell grade the embryos like cocaine  shell be like ooh yeah these ones these are agrade embryos right here   these ones these are these are bgrade embryos so so i dont know  these these ones these are cgrade embryos  oh and these ones yeah these these are these are dgrade embryos yeah these these will storm the capitol someday alright so  you dont want that and then  and then you have to like draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics and you dont know youre just projecting data you just hope youre not throwing away a tom brady in the  round thats going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you cant measure the human spirit and uh we all like to think were good people in this room but were all picking the agrade embryos okay no one here is not picking your agrade embryos if given a choice even if you were a bgrade embryo  you would still pick your agrade embryos because youll be like i know what its like im not putting my kids through this bgrade human existence with sweaty palms and sciatica  give me the agrade shit give me the best we could do give my kid a fighting chance and it got me thinking about the future a little bit because i never wanted kids i never thought i would have kids the only thing i ever wanted to do my whole life was this standup comedy in america  its the best look at this its the best you are cheering because you know this is way better than having kids   so much more fun and lucrative well the blastocysts are real now theres eight of them waiting for me in the cloud um  chance of successful implantation with gradea embryos so i guess that makes me a mass murderer in alabama it got me thinking about the future what kind of parent am i gonna be am i gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were or am i gonna be better than my parents were be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck youre supposed to be now and thinking about it turns out im gonna be just as bad as my parents were i can i can feel it i can feel it inside me i can feel the i can feel the chinese inside me i can just feel that high expectation just low tolerance for excuses its in here its right in here its like the default app you know you cant delete the calculator app theres no x when you shake it theres no x you can move it off the home screen but its still in the os embedded  in the operating system i can feel the chinese if my blastocyst was real if it entered this reality and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever oh my god look at this blastocyst everybody look look at how beautiful this blastocyst is i love you so much blastocyst i love you much more than i thought i would  and your blastocyst is hugging you back right theyre like  i love you too daddy daddy daddy when i grow up i want to be a standup comedian just like you  i just feel the chinese coming on right i just  you take your glasses off like hitler in the bunker  standup comedy are you out of your fucking mind  thats not even a real job what do you think is gonna happen just gonna run around america and tell jokes to strangers who dont give a fuck about your mental health and even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds and make it to even a semiprofessional level as a standup comedian do you think theres any chance in hell youll be funnier than me    dad is a borderline arena act in some markets have you seen my imdb page im in everything i will fucking crush your career osoto gari your mother and i just spent a fortune to make an agrade blastocyst for them to become a bgrade comedian i will never watch anything you do go to law school   is what my father said to me  i do think its tough for straight men in  to sincerely look up selfimprovement on the internet without five weeks later storming the capitol okay that mens selfhelp youtube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now okay im not saying its the biggest problem in the world clearly but it is a problem okay because men were genetically predisposed to seek selfimprovement okay were trying to be better people every day believe it or not women  once we hit a certain age okay usually we die before then through suicide or environmental factors bmx biking dietary choices but if you can live long enough as a man you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective okay you start seeking guidance from outside sources you start looking at watches like like every man in this room has or will at some point weve all been there guys weve all done this weve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives and weve been like what a fucking piece of shit  i fucking hate this loser look at this loser fuck this loser i hate this person i need to be a better person let me start by getting fit   let me work on my health that seems like a logical place to start my journey let me control what i can control in here so what do you do as a man you go on youtube right you look up how to lift weights right you press enter you click on the first video its some guy doing kettlebell swings right hell teach you how to lock your core so you dont break your fucking spine and then you do that for two days you feel pretty good about yourself  whoo right and on the third day the same youtube channel has a new video notification alert the men are like whats this new video from kettlebellswinging guy what could he be doing in his new video in the video the kettlebellswinging guy hes doing the new kettlebell exercise the lawnmower hes doing that and then like  seconds into the video he just suddenly just stops and he looks really sad and he puts the kettlebell down and he looks straight into the camera and hes like yo guys just real talk for a second all right  kettlebells are great but i just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind  and all the men watching this are like yeah  yeah that makes sense that feels right in here tell me more kettlebellswinging guy  what other advice do you have for all areas of my life including my relationships and financial investments please give me guidance kettlebellswinging guy so what do you do you watch his next video on autoplay then you watch his next video here comes the youtube algorithm with a suggested video and here comes another suggested video and a week later jordan peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men  five weeks later youre storming the capitol dressed like a buffalo    thats a very realistic sequence of events by the way thats not even an exaggerated timeline every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm we all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that mens selfhelp andrew tate masculinity youtube selfhelp algorithm if you dont know anyone who lost their mind  youre the one who lost their mind youre currently in an echo chamber of assholes cause real friends tell you when youre losing your mind its very tragic all these men who are trying to be better people and theyre seeking guidance but that youtube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves theres tragedy in that like all those people they were just trying to lift weights  they werent trying to cause an insurrection they didnt even know what that word meant they were just trying to do this theyre trying to do this they didnt know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis\\u00e0vis their torso right is it  degrees or  degrees like is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you they googled it one time and then five weeks later youre taking a shit on nancy pelosis desk  and the us marshals are garnishing your wages because you take one wrong turn and life moves pretty quick im not saying as a man dont take responsibility for your own actions okay im just saying that youtube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys it it sucks men in in a way that i dont think women understand it really preys on that mens need to seek guidance from somewhere its very hard to resist it just draws draws you in thats why fucking mark zuckerberg is trying to mma fight elon musk right now  that guy fell for his own algorithm do you understand mark zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd and for like  years now hes just been looking at our data right jerking off every single day just looking at our data jerking off money piling up billions of dollars data jerking off money money jerking off data for  years that loop and who knew after two decades of that one day he just looked at so much data he was like oh shit oh shit he fell into it now hes trying to mmafight elon musk that guy jerked off and came on his own face  like its out of control zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality and he invented that shit and he still fell for it what hope does the average man in america have just walking just waddling down the street looking looking for a taco on his phone hes gonna get sucked into his phone he has no chance that fucking guy has no chance because even the good guys in this room were all like on a razors edge to being a piece of shit okay  that margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razorthin i gotta tell you if you have the means every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge and you know what an instagram post could push it either way  okay it depends on the post was it cute animals or was it boobs  thats gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours i do think as a society we need to uh do a better job of identifying like when we have a disagreement with someone whos genuinely trying to have a goodfaith discussion to reach higher understanding and whos just talking shit we are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit and were not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics like for example me right now im just talking shit okay  this is oneway shittalking i dont care about any of your opinions do not send me any of them i do not care you paid for me i didnt pay a cent for any of you okay   free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shittalking session if you dont like it take it out on adam smith but if i was having a conversation with someone i disagree with in good faith i would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with thatd be a logical place to start a difficult conversation for example maga make america great again they have a point americas not doing so great right now right our kids math scores are down  our childrens science scores are down when judged according to international metrics uh healthcare systems not doing so great wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially there was an implied promise to a generation of americans that if you do certain things work hard go to college be a good person you would have certain outcomes and those outcomes didnt materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decisionmaking positions lowered the capital gains tax  so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year in postworld war ii us leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for national security by making the us dollar the default international trade currency which gave america the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a us financial banking system but consequently increased the value of the us dollar astronomically which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in america  although the logic at the time  was that americans were supposed to upskill en masse away from the menial manufacturing jobs but everyone heres too much of a dumbass to stay school so we just traded domestic manufacturing to asia and the rest of the world at the expense of workingclass families but if you dont read enough  it comes out as lets go brandon  and its like you have a point but you dont have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didnt read enough you gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag theres a book behind the word you gotta keep going you can go at your own pace but you gotta finish the required reading otherwise we cant have a conversation were all catching up to each other im friends with maga im friends with the magas some of them are my good friends  whoo yeah hawaii maga  the friendliest of all maga  aloha maga theyre in hawaii right now making aloha great again i became friends with them because i filmed two seasons of a tv show in hawaii doogie kame\\u0101loha on disney   maga hawaii welcomed me into their homes ronny please come over please were having a barbecue wed love you to meet the family meet the ohana please wed love to have you over so gracious you show up theyre so warm and welcoming thanks for coming take whatever you want theres some kalua pork theres some loco mocos hot dogs hey here here touch my gun  touch it just touch just take it im always like i i dont want to touch any of these guns okay i dont know where theyve been i dont know where theyre going i dont have time in my schedule to attend depositions  just give me the loco moco  very passionate people my maga friends and i respect their passion to some extent i do theyre like i love america i would die for this country and i believe them i believe they love america and i believe they would die for this country which is very admirable but its like man you are willing to die for your country why arent you willing to learn math  also for your country like like do both for your country i know you wanna die for your country but were losing the engineering jobs to asia right now so if you we need less people to die for their country we need more people to do their homework for their country like do your homework for your country like actually sit down and show the work and like do the thats a more efficient way to show your patriotism if you take that i want to die energy and you put it into homework you will fucking top the school im telling you its skys the limit  dude youll youll solve a lot of problems youll create a lot of jobs youll increase the gdp just do do your homework for your country id rather die  i i thought so i thought that might be i thought that might be the case dyings easy math is hard  these quadratic equations making me suicidal uh we try not to talk about politics my maga friends and i out of mutual respect inevitably it comes up some stuff im wrong about some stuff theyre right about but sometimes like their messaging is so convoluted like i cant get to what their core issue actually is because their surface messaging is so chaotic like sometimes theyre like ronny china caused covid but covid isnt real  so is it fine then does it mean its fine i dont know how to feel about it now cause one minus one is zero i dont know what to tell you the the math analogy works for concepts not just numbers you can x is anything why are you yelling at me about china always yelling at me about china china is doing this china did a weather balloon with a camera chinas got an artificial island in the pacific doubling as an aircraft carrier base chinas doing tiktok why is china doing tiktok i dont know  im not from china im from malaysia  im from malaysia not china im im thirdgeneration chinese malaysian malaysia you know michelle yeoh oscar winner malaysia yeah thats malaysia samasama malaysia saya anak malaysia malaysia malaysia not china malaysia we are the ones who lost the plane  okay you guys remember that did you see the documentary on netflix suggested after my special you guys see that that was us  that was us were the lose the plane people okay were not the human rights whatever i dont know tiktok i dont know what that is okay were the  ah where is it where the fuck is it thats us uh my my maga friends all hate us tax thats like a universal party platform theres different types of maga right theres like maga light maga concentrated but like right its unfair to group them under one banner but one uniting party principle is love america fuck us tax and i get it i also hate us tax now that im in the highest bracket  yeah im maga with that fuck us tax yeah fuck american tax feels good to say it like the words give you power right fuck us tax fuck american tax you like it you like it when i say it when this fucking foreigner says it you like that fuck us tax you like that you like it when this accent says that fuck american tax you like that you dont see a discrepancy in energy love america usa usa fuck us tax put politics aside for just three seconds okay if its even possible just for three seconds just consider this concept in a vacuum just as an academic exercise okay when you love something you give it money  right like thats one of the primary ways we show love for individuals organizations ideas on kickstarter sports teams we go like yeah we give it money so when you go love america usa usa fuck us tax so what are you saying you love america so much you want it to be poor you want your country to be poor you want it to be a beggar on the street a street beggar you want your country to be a street beggar on the street i love my mom sometimes i give my mom money  give your mom money sometimes  yeah look how alien this concept is to white people   just silence  give your mom money sometimes for what  because shes your ma  and you love her right she loves you back so fucking cut her off a piece every once in a while probably tore stuff giving birth to you cut her a piece of the pie arbitrarily even just give a im sure your mother would appreciate it no matter who your mom is how selfaccomplished she is im sure your mom could use it fix the driveway invest in infrastructure something  sometimes americans treat their country the way they treat their parents  yeah  i love my mom i love my mom i would die for my mom but fuck her she made her choices  i love being in america i do i love being here i had my options i came here i love being in america because this is the country that puts show business above everything and i am in the business of show business so naturally im gonna come here and do it i do this in america fuck america fuck the president fuck us tax money money just comes into  fuck the president hes too old fuck this president the money comes in money just comes in like printing money i do this in malaysia same same words same same clothing same haircut facing the same direction in malaysia jail  like the arbitrage value is out of control same product in different loc obviously ill do this here why the fuck would i do it anywhere else its the best i think uh sometimes people forget im a firstgeneration immigrant here because my secondgeneration or later american friends like their parents were immigrants and the way they talk about their parents is so disrespectful and they forget like im also an immigrant theyll be like you know my parents theyre immigrants you know immigrants theyre so cheap  like dont come over my familys over this weekend my parents are here my parents are immigrants you know immigrants ugh theyre so cheap yo i want to defend immigrants here for a second all right fuck that shit yeah my mom lives in singapore she is not an immigrant she is still extremely cheap  okay being cheap is not an immigrant thing its genetic  cheap people are cheap theyre not choosing to be cheap its just inside its not a choice chinese baby boomers are cheap cause they dont know how to have fun they havent had fun in like  years they like forgot the energy of fun like of all the asians right now in the asian fun hierarchy from most fun to least fun chinese baby boomers least fun of all the asians right now i can say this im chinese okay you dont fucking say it  this is our n word you dont fucking say it i say it you dont fucking say it least fun you dont fucking say it least fun of all the asians chinese baby boomers right now of all the asians most fun asians uh the koreans okay you gotta give it up for the koreans   give it up for the koreans you gotta tip your cap and respect the backtoback championships of the modernday koreans just killing it with the fun and the pop culture theyre everyones theyve got blackpink they got music they got bts  dude bts is right now in the army fighting kim jongun  do you understand bts is at the dmz right now just going    just an unstoppable force of entertainment  taking down countries and dictatorships they got uh koreans got uh the parasite movie oscarwinning they got past lives they got uh crash landing on you  just dominating the netflix home page of white people  never thought id see the day when white peoples homepage is full of kdrama just binging nonstop they got uh squid game dude koreans have more fun dying in squid game than chinese people have at comedy shows chinese people at comedy shows theyre looking at their phone do i have to look up hes here okay im gonna video for six minutes full flash video this is this is how i live in the moment as a chinese person koreans most fun uh filipinos know how to have fun  yeah they love having fun uh vietnamese people know how to have fun cambodians know how to have fun hmong people know how to have fun even japanese know how to have fun in a reserved way  outwardly stoic inside just anime  outside unreadable inside just the intro to sailor moon right just   outside is just ohayo gozaimasu  japanese people have so much fun sometimes they go straight back to work  youre not gonna change your suit just straight into the office alright  uh everyone knows chinese baby boomers least fun of all the asians because for chinese baby boomers their primary directive in life is do not get scammed thats like the overriding directive that informs the entire decisionmaking tree robocop primary directive do not get scammed do not arrest ocp executive do not get scammed and for chinese baby boomers theres no value proposition okay its just pure price sensitivity that means any money outgoing is a scam  if money leaves my possession that was a scam  so the whole time theyre just tensed up theyre just looking for scams when they go out theyre just like they cant even relax scams coming itll be a twodrink minimum over here parking guys tip  tensing up meanwhile koreans in the back just having fun  filipinos dancing like chinese baby boomers just tensed up the further they get from their house as distance x increases they know the fees will increase and so the ex the expenditures are gonna increase so they keep tensing up the further they get until eventually like their whole body tenses up into like a c right like a c for chinese  and then in the back youre like go go have fun have fun they just refuse to have fun like my mom came and visited me in new york city her only son she came to new york city new york city is the kind of city where as soon as you open your front door its like  like if you touch your door knob its like apple pay  just going it goes into the universe my mom came in and approached the front door in new york shes like in the back of the apartment im good i dont need to leave the house today my mom isnt even scared of asian hate shes more scared of inflation  she cant believe the prices of things anymore you take her out to central park lets go to central park its free look how beautiful new york is in autumn look at this why are these hot dogs five dollars its like no this the price is right no one is scamming you thats the correct amount of money to pay for that you havent been out of the house in  years that number is correct thats how much things cost after baby boomers destroyed the global financial economy in  pursuing subprime mortgages okay thats thats if anything you scammed yourself thats you scamming yourself yeah you played yourself dj khaled  my mom came to visit me in hawaii her first time in hawaii and if you know hawaii locals and the hawaiians here the least scammy culture on the planet could not be more generous as a community you get so much more than you give when youre on the islands of hawaii and uh my mom comes and she lands and she gets to the hotel and they welcome her aloha welcome to hawaii and they put a lei over her like a ring of flowers they put it over her and my mom does this  im not paying for that  and im like you cant do that mom theyre not trying to trick you into buying something theyre trying to welcome you to their homeland theyre not tricking you into buying just cause you touched it this isnt thailand just put on  put on the lei youre embarrassing me in front of the hawaiians mahalo    these chinese baby boomers most scared of being scammed in real life the first to get scammed on the internet for people who live in fear their entire lives extremely gullible because these baby boomers they dont have the they dont have the antibodies to deal with the internet completely clueless when they go on now like watching baby boomers go on the internet now is like watching babies wandering into the kitchen by themselves just looking for cookies on the kitchen countertop just like running their hands blindly on the kitchen countertop pulling down knives kitchen knives coming straight down into their eyeballs into like the soft part of their skull they go in the kitchen they open the oven they turn it on they stick their head inside theyre like any pictures of my grandkids in here is this link safe to click on is this link safe to click on is this link safe to click on just falling for every basic bitch internet scam possible these fucking baby boomers tumbling into internet scams like pandas rolling down a hill  just jujitsurolling into scams every single day loving scams oh what do you want  target gift cards yeah sounds like a legitimate way to pay for antivirus software on my phone everybody look look at this link look theres a whats the one trick your doctor doesnt want you to know okay ill click on that link i knew it i knew my doctor was scamming me that was a trick he didnt want me to know im gonna invalidate his medical degree with one click right now  this is not the scam my doctor is the scam let me  click on this these fucking internet idiot savants who cant remember a single goddamn password but for some reason can make any piece of misinformation go viral like a russian cyber army just spreading misinformation around the world in family group whatsapp chats everywhere everybody just look at this article is this real look at it is this real its how they factcheck they spread it look at this this is a real everybody weigh in im not saying a hair dryer in your mouth will kill covid okay but what you cant ask questions anymore look at this article from cnnnnnru quick send it to your uncle send it to your send it to our whole family tree everybody needs to see this has there ever been a dumber generation of idiots more susceptible to fake news than these fucking baby boomers literally believing everything they see on the internet i get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last due to the exponential technology growth curve okay but this has got to be the biggest gap in human history the information asymmetry right now is just out of control you literally have people in honolulu right now autodriving their tesla cybertrucks as they vape out the window and their phone ai is trading cryptocurrency meanwhile you have baby boomers they cant even rightclick  they cant even rightclick theres one button how do you rightclick on one button its scary they dont know whats real anymore hey ronny look at this photo of bigfoot shopping at whole foods  bigfoot is real now look theres an image of him buying kombucha at whole foods what technology exists that can fake images im like mom thats not real stop sending it around its not real how do you know they always get so indignant about it like how do you know that its not real how did you know that because the font the font is off and the resolution of the image is blurry and that lighting state doesnt make sense for that image and thats not standard dimensions for a news article i cant give you this knowledge its like malcolm gladwells blink ive seen so much shit on the internet my brain instantly filters it youll never have this skill set so just stay off the internet this world is not for you anymore stop making decisions  but anyway respect your elders  its a confucian value maybe if you give your mom some money she wouldnt get scammed so much yeah well think about the correlation between those two phenomena uh people always ask me like why do you shit on your mom for money why dont you shit on your dad for money alright uh  no i dont talk about my dad because uh my dad has no context for show business like we grew up in malaysia like his families are rubber tappers in malaysia my aunts and uncles are still in sitiawan in malaysia right now tapping rubber they have no context for show business very smart people but they dont know this world my dad he was the first guy in his family to get a college education he went to manchester college which has merged with the university of southern new hampshire he got his masters of economics there put himself through it very smart guy and he was a good immigrant he came to america to new hampshire to get his education and when he graduated he went back to malaysia he didnt take anyones job he left  and my dad had the vision to see what i didnt see he knew he had a ceiling on him because of the way he thinks and talks and he went back to malaysia and he was right for him he went back it was the right choice for him he became a very successful corporate executive uh he retired to a farm in johor bahru malaysia love farming he retired to a farm thats how much this guy loved it but he had no context for show business so he wouldnt understand anything im doing like he wouldnt understand what im doing in godzilla vs kong hed be like why dont you just run that way  dad i dont control the edit okay im just honolulu chinatown shopkeeper no  in this in this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla okay im just connecting act  to act  i dont have a say in how this plays out because of that i stopped telling him about what i was doing i felt he wouldnt get it and he stopped asking me so i didnt tell him i got hired on the daily show he found out the way all parents find out about their kids accolades through a local newspaper so one day the local paper reported that i got hired on the daily show and he called me immediately he was like ronny whats this i hear about you joining the everyday show and i was like oh no its the daily show i joined like two years ago dad he was like oh okay well whats the daily show im like its just like another latenight american talk show they kind of invented modern american satire and  and uh my dad was like oh thats cool are you the host im like no im a correspondent he was like what is that whats a correspondent im like yeah correspondent is i help the host with comedy segments and he was like oh okay hey mei hes just a sidekick  and so he had like no context for what was a win what was a milestone in this industry and so i stopped telling him and he stopped asking me and i didnt need that from him we we were totally fine wed talk about other stuff not about work we werent fighting it was all good uh and he passed away very suddenly uh in  he died on christmas eve died on his farm like no warning no explanation he just left one day he left so suddenly we had to go back to handle his estate if anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position when you have to handle someone elses estate it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life and so its me my wife my sister brotherinlaw went back to johor bahru and part of me trying to figure out his estate was i had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using so his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it and i opened it up and its passwordprotected and i know this guy so well im like his password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child so  i type in my sisters birthday and spot on spot on it was my sisters birthday  as it should be shes like an anesthesiologist in australia shes like way more respectable person than me actually saving lives like a good person contributing back to society not like this fucking asshole i get in  i get in trouble on the internet for shit i said two years ago every six weeks so it should be her she should be the favorite so i log into his computer i open his web browser i look at his browsing history and the whole time im like please dont let me find my dads porn please dont let me find what positions my dad was into even if it was just missionary i wouldnt be able to handle it im gonna have to burn this laptop for real chinese people when we burn things it goes to our ancestors and then my granddad is gonna see it and its like i dont i dont want that for them ill be fine but theyre gonna have an awkward time im considerate like that uh so i open the web browser look at his history and way to go dad no porn what a cleancut guy no porn he only went on the internet twice a day like clockwork  am and  pm like the farmer that he was and every time he went on the internet hed only go to two websites each time so the first website hed go to was a local news website and the second website hed go to twice a day every single day was my twitter page  aw so hed be reloading my twitter page twice a day just to see what i was doing and i post stuff like hey honolulu hawaii i sold out five shows uh this week whys there so many homeless people here id post stuff like that  and uh he would read that and then hed be like i assume hed be like oh ronnys doing okay hes in hawaii he sold out some shows and oh i guess theres a lot of homeless people in hawaii uh and um that was his quiet way of keeping up with me he never told me that and i never knew that and we never discussed it um which is a very nice sentiment unfortunately uh as best as i can tell this is the last tweet my dad read of mine  so as best as i can tell forensically based on internet browsing timestamps the last tweet my dad read of mine and quite possibly the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm was me posting on twitter if youre a baby boomer on twitter i already know youre a fucking loser  now obviously this was not directed towards him i didnt even know he had twitter i didnt even know he knew what twitter was but i stand by the statement   and i know thats kind of a weird way to end the show but um   if its any solace uh this was his phone when he died  aw that was his uh wallpaper and his screensaver and  and i didnt even know and its a photo of me and my wife and were in hawaii and im wearing two leis cause my mom threw one off and i put it on  and uh i didnt know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper uh and  uh i i like to i like to think that uh that is the last image he saw of me thats what he remembered me by when he left and uh i also would like to tell my sister i won  i won it was me it was me you guys have

to get this shit over with cause i have to pee in  ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for coming  its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that  i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat  shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through and then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its  to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find out  i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books  fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was  the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost   and everybody thought it was  this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was  the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was  you never know when you might need this and i was  but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success i grew up a lot this past year  this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and  hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was  oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was  oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was  all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had  we had we had so much chemistry he was  hey wassup i was  wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was  hey can you drop me off i was  where he was  at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was  oh no i just fucked a homeless dude again my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who   wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they  to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it  because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude  you feel  youre in a wes anderson movie or something and  white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff  voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff  that and its very  its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel  im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement  just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im  i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer  but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you  you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on  my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was  hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its  making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just  a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night  oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre  i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more  loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell  responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding  between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things  host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse   learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up  filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was  its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was  its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total  private school asians we both are big hippies too we  to backpack through southeast asia we  to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit  that  we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes  freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats  a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel  we are white people doing an impression of asian people  we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were  oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so  i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because  that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre  im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is  shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always  oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013  you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and  very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be  were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be  we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre  but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do  how much shittier food tastes when  you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be  look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im  that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retired i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day  youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically  wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre  oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks  its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to  squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want  its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was  you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently  and he was  hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was  why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes  mrs pacman just lets redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was   youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really  freaked out about anal and theyre  oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel  youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt  i got a second chance at life  i was  oh my god its  im going back in time \\u266a a whole new world \\u266a it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah  a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your\\u2013 just give your man a little\\u2013 a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari  and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont\\u2013 no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they  it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i  that fear that shit turns me on  especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye  hes discovered nirvana and its  youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim  my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when\\u2013 when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right  i respect you right im  yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who  to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their\\u2013 glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control   i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live  i just wanna be out of control for once just\\u2013 just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cunt im just waiting for the right moment to  become a housewife financially  i want my husband to get us to  a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people thats the kind of income bracket im striving for thats when  youve made it when youre eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple  what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking  a princess i have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be  guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are  thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me  a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were  ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was  yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won  another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were  why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was  yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed  a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and  why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were  yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im  oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here  i need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre  im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are  the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because  im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me  im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbusters i dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b  skittles so my uterus probably looked  a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act  everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich  mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were  oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was  only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be  were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its  release the kraken and they just come out  a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship  and  yeah and most of the time  we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be  ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look  they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be  hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymore im very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre  oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was   yeah where im from thats  losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was  no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was  yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was  you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted im scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula  what that is  what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did  that youre gonna poop on the table i was  yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense  that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channel i can already see how theres  this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommy  i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i  i berate my husband on  a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant  your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see  a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then  they get big\\u2013 they get big  fingers  you you you owe me money you my nipples look  whoppers now and naked i look  a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not  when i was  years old when it was  really hot  and i was  why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporin so  i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos  way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and  two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnant all right ive been ali wong have a good night everybody thank you your email address will not

eric clapton and the challenger everything else everything else is fake but everything im about to tell you from here until the end of the show thats all true now i dont tell dark jokes because im a comedian im a comedian because i tell dark jokes im kind of fucked up all right ive always been this way i cant really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends its ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyones funeral i asked a friend for advice was  ive never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and dont tell a joke try not to so i walked up and was   what my favorite memory was when i was  four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it  mark twain out of my grandmas mouth it would just come to life and then i couldnt help myself i said and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the n word now i promise you i promise you until youve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wifes funeral at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think im one of the best comedians of all time but heres the thing it doesnt matter if you believe me it really doesnt matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i  to test myself i  to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i  to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i dont believe in too soon im on a tight schedule and im good at it im good at it  the day of the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted other than that how was the movie right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that the reason i get away with stuff  that is im just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didnt make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i dont follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying dont do it and whenever i see that whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad cause i know something horrible has happened people will say anthony whats funny about aurora whats funny about the boston marathon whats funny about your grandmothers funeral nothing nothing is funny about those things thats where i come in so i see these texts and im  oh no what happened but i also think ive got a job to do so i go online i start reading about it i dont want to watch the footage but ill read about what happened and i think how can i make someone laugh today and then i think i got it i go back on twitter and i tweet guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed especially the finish line and again i think nailed it usa usa but then my phone starts to ring and its my boss or should i say my former boss and they say anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today youre also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or youre fired and i say go fuck yourselves and i meant it i didnt get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because im dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said sure they said well anthony you dont understand you dont understand at all if you dont take this joke down right now if you dont delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people theyre also out of a job and im ashamed to tell you this im embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke cause im happy to fight for what i believe in im happy to take the consequences for what ive done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet couldnt do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now ill tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in im just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture theyre  anthony were family why are you so upset cant you see we did you a favor dont you worry about your career let me ask you san francisco do i seem  i worry about my career no  why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if theyre worried about their money they wouldnt have played the lottery in the first fuckin place i do not worry about my career and they said anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems  youre making fun of the victims and thats wrong but thats not what im doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell me im wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking hey are we trending no this is who im making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston do  what thats worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying dont forget about me today dont forget about me lots of crazy distractions in the news but dont forget how sad i am those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of theyre  a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understand now im sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it its fine its embarrassing but its fun you can laugh at yourself its not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me thats fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess thats what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called shark party all right now some of you enjoyed it but if youve never seen shark party you can never see shark party its been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year  million sharks are killed by human beings every year   people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack im  fuck yeah win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say  what i want to have a shark party as soon as theres a shark attack were having a shark party and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do ive already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark its time for a shark party lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing ive ever said on television smile you son of a bitch shark party and in america where im famous for those types of shenanigans everybody was  anthony that was fucked up it was fucked up to see you dance end of controversy however in new zealand where they dont get my show theyve never seen me and frankly they dont get out much the new zealand media takes the video and they show it to the guys family and they say what do you guys think about this and they say crikey or whatever the fuck they say over there the point is all of new zealand all of new zealand rises up against me all  of those cunts rise up and start threatening my life now i dont read the things that people write about me on the internet but i pay people who do and they come to me and theyre  weve got some terrible news please sit down they say you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of shark party and i was  really new zealand wants to kill me thats weird because they didnt even kill the shark i said how many death threats am i getting and they were  oh all of them you are getting all of the death threats what do you want us to do we can send someone to talk to them extra security what do you want i said no forget about it leave it alone dont worry this might be hard for some to understand ive said it several times tonight everyone is going to die i know full well i am going to die and most of us dont get to choose how we check out but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes best case scenario if somebody murders me over one of my jokes i immediately become a legend im a comedy god the mount rushmore of comedy is me four times i said come on then my security guys are   anthony well just so  that is the dumbest thing weve ever heard but youre the boss  and they leave and then the next day they come back and they say anthony sorry to bother you again i know you didnt care yesterday but its gotten much worse youre gonna wanna hear this they say someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dads phone number and address in pittsburgh posted that online and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand and i have to admit that had never occurred to me before it never crossed my mind that my family my loved ones would ever pay the price be caught in harms way for something ive done or ive joked about and honestly i would cut my throat for my jokes i would give my life for what i do but if anyone and i mean this for a fact if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke ive made even better this man is fantastici watched the show  times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable  great material so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is  but a joke about a famous musicians son falling to his death isnt  where are your priorities theyre just jokes  its just syllables formed together  theyre just words people are monsters these are just words your email address will not be published required fields are marked  name

we can make embryos so we can freeze the embryos so that we do not have to have kids right now because kids are what you have when youve given up on your own hopes and dreams  im still trying here i look at my friends who are my age who have kids and they all look  shit  its gotten to the point where i cant even take a photo with them and post it on my main grid because it messes up the aesthetics of my instagram too much with their fucking haggard faces just drooping wrinkly crowsfeetembedded heads receding hairlines just withering graying hair coming out in clumps because of their children  i did a show and someone i went to high school with in singapore came to the show and after the show i met up with them and they brought another person with them and i was  oh is this other person your mom thank you so much for bringing your mother to my show and that other person was also someone i went to high school with  thats how fucking ugly  these people have become because of their children just unrecognizable so im trying to use money and science to push the curve back a little bit and  first step of harvesting my wifes eggs is i have to inject my wife twice a day for two weeks so i have to inject my wife i am the one injecting my wife twice a day for two weeks zero medical training i was given no medical training whatsoever the government lets you do this the the doctor asked me to do it the doctor was  hey have you ever held a needle before no perfect here take this and inject your wife in the middle of her body  nicolas cage in the rock  twice a day for two weeks with chemicals that we mail to you mystery chemicals that we send to your house in unmarked brown boxes just trust us that its the right thing that youre injecting into the person you love the most internet chemicals that show up it comes in a powder i have to make it into a liquid you understand its a meth lab in my kitchen as im mixing the comp im sweating the whole time cause im scared ill fuck up the measurements and kill my wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely then you have to  the air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements and then you have to put it in the syringe then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude   what youre doing   i dont know what im doing i saw someone do this on doogie howser   i dont even know the angle to put it into her   it looks so painful going in  i love my wife so much i cant even bear to watch her in pain i couldnt even bear to watch the needle go into her i had to inject my wife  this i had to  cover my eyes and  backhand it  into her  kurosawa  did i get the middle of your body no  just walk into the needle  im supposed to do all the work here meet me halfway and  the doctor said if you do everything right if you measure correctly you inject at the right times they scan  this part of her body  that chicago bulls logo right and they were   if you do everything right based on what we can tell you should expect  eggs  and my wife ended up getting   yeah always a  yeah always  a late halfhearted response to  usually the women in the crowd are  whoo yeah all the men in the crowd are always   is that a good number is  a good number of eggs how many eggs equal one bebe is it four eggs is one bebe so  eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together let me put this in a language that men can understand  twentysix eggs from one vagina in one cycle is mvp numbers  twentysix eggs is  if magic johnson averaged the tripledouble and killed his own aids   thats the level of medical miracle thats happening in whatever this part of my wifes body that horn of the bull that  curls into itself the doctor  scraped out  eggs out of my wifes vagina  salmon roe just scooping out just dripping out and then you put it in some nigiri right and then you eat it thats how babies are made you gotta salt bae the eggs onto the ikura and then you eat it so  were trying to make embryos so eggs thats just half the equation i dont know if  how embryos are made but eggs thats just half of it she did her part admirably so now i have to contribute my half of the embryo equation so im sitting in the doctors office   a wet pigeon all right and the doctor comes over and the doctors a woman because of course she is shes  good morning mr chieng so  whens the last time you ejaculated my wife is right here and shes  yeah when is the last time you ejaculated  we would all  to know its the one time in life where youre not allowed to lie about jerking off its when a medical professional is asking you a direct question and its for reproduction its for the intended purpose so you gotta tell the truth so im  whatever ill tell the truth  let me check my calendar   i guess the last time i ejaculated was  let me see  yesterday around  pm  and my wife is  yesterday i was with you all day  and i was  yeah but remember when you took out the trash   because i also put up mvp numbers against a shot clock and heavy defensive pressure but i was thinking of you the whole time its really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever vietnamese people eat my wife is vietnamese ive no idea what the fuck she eats n\\u01b0\\u1edbc m\\u1eafm  and i went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off its the medical jerkingoff room every hospital has a medical jerkingoff room  its nondescript not a lot of signage smaller than i think it should be lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt and im sitting in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and theres grown men outside the door waiting for me to finish  so they too can use the medical jerkingoff room that we are sharing  a wework  and im in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and i couldnt go  sorry sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand im sorry sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me sorry sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters as they code to death painfully and the families crying in the waiting room wasnt turning me on  so i couldnt go i couldnt go so i just call  right im    im  these people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room  i call the doctor back in and im  doc i cant go  i cant medically ejaculate under these circumstances the vibes are off let me go home let me go home to medically ejaculate can i do that and the doctors  yeah you can go home but  as soon as it comes out of your body it expires quicker than avocados in hawaii  youve got  you have  a  window before theres  an exponential decreasing probability of  im   fine ill go home ill medically ejaculate ill come back in  minutes no problem so i go home open the front door ejaculate immediately  this is   this is home court advantage i know where everything is i know whats behind me i look at the dripping garbage bag  its  a pavlovian response at this point  i ejaculate into a cup  its a cup that they gave me its not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen  that says worlds best dad on it  its the cup that they use doctors give you to test your pee for drugs its got a really tight cap right so i ejaculate into the cup it keeps overflowing so i gotta keep  pouring it out  just overwhelming amounts  its  ghostbusters  up in here   i fill it to the brim and then i scrape off the top and then i and then i seal the cap as tight as i can right get it really nice and tight and then i i put it inside my tshirt next to my skin under my armpit nice and snug because the doctor told me to do that because apparently  the titanic your body heat will keep your people alive and then i run downstairs and i jump into a new york city taxi and im  take me to langone hospital please hurry up the taxi driver is  what the fuck are you doing with your hand are you  im  oh yeah no im fine no its not me its my my wife shes wait a person its my jizz  and new york city taxis have seen much worse so the taxi driver was  oh  cool thank you for using a cup  unlike the last two dudes who were back there just raw dogging at the jfk  what im saying and  we get to the we get to the hospital right i open the taxi door i run into the hospital and because its new york city someone on the sidewalk is  hey yo hey yo were you that guy in shangchi  am i yes i was a minor character in the marvel movie shangchi not the main guy and the guys  yo yo can i get a photo with you and im   sure  so we take a photo  this so someone on the internet has a photo of me and this stranger and im doing this  napoleon if you ever come across this photo just know i am holding my own jizz  so feel free to tag it  he was very grateful he was  aw thanks so much man and i was  no problem man i shake his hand right  because i love meeting my fans and i run into the hospital right already hitting the  mark end of the fourth quarter theres no time left on the clock so i just take my jizz and i just throw a buzzerbeater right the doctor  catches my jizz    odell beckham she just  one hand grabs it and  in the same motion without even putting it down she  alleyoops my jizz into my wifes eggs right just takes it and she goes boom shakalaka and  my sperm goes into my wifes eggs and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg nobody knows its a mystery its a mystery of the universe nobody knows when sperm goes into the egg its unknowable ooh its its  the event horizon on a black hole no one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes nothing happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes it becomes a bubble tea  nobody knows where bubble tea comes from its tapioca the sperm goes into the egg and then you shake it and you go to vegas you throw it on the crap table and if youre lucky if you get a good dice roll right it becomes a blastocyst thats what we call future humans blastocysts it becomes embryos the doctor shell take all the embryos and shell look at them under the microscope and shell grade the embryos  cocaine  shell be  ooh yeah these ones these are agrade embryos right here   these ones these are these are bgrade embryos so so i dont know  these these ones these are cgrade embryos  oh and these ones yeah these these are these are dgrade embryos yeah these these will storm the capitol someday  so  you dont want that and then  and then you have to  draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics and you dont know youre just projecting data you just hope youre not throwing away a tom brady in the  round thats going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you cant measure the human spirit and  we all  to think were good people in this room but were all picking the agrade embryos  no one here is not picking your agrade embryos if given a choice even if you were a bgrade embryo  you would still pick your agrade embryos because youll be  i know what its  im not putting my kids through this bgrade human existence with sweaty palms and sciatica  give me the agrade shit give me the best we could do give my kid a fighting chance and it got me thinking about the future a little bit because i never wanted kids i never thought i would have kids the only thing i ever wanted to do my whole life was this standup comedy in america  its the best look at this its the best you are cheering because  this is way better than having kids   so much more fun and lucrative well the blastocysts are real now theres eight of them waiting for me in the cloud   chance of successful implantation with gradea embryos so i guess that makes me a mass murderer in alabama it got me thinking about the future what kind of parent am i gonna be am i gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were or am i gonna be better than my parents were be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck youre supposed to be now and thinking about it turns out im gonna be just as bad as my parents were i can i can feel it i can feel it inside me i can feel the i can feel the chinese inside me i can just feel that high expectation just low tolerance for excuses its in here its right in here its  the default app  you cant delete the calculator app theres no x when you shake it theres no x you can move it off the home screen but its still in the os embedded  in the operating system i can feel the chinese if my blastocyst was real if it entered this reality and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever oh my god look at this blastocyst everybody look look at how beautiful this blastocyst is i love you so much blastocyst i love you much more than i thought i would  and your blastocyst is hugging you back right theyre   i love you too daddy daddy daddy when i grow up i want to be a standup comedian just  you  i just feel the chinese coming on right i just  you take your glasses off  hitler in the bunker  standup comedy are you out of your fucking mind  thats not even a real job what do you think is gonna happen just gonna run around america and tell jokes to strangers who dont give a fuck about your mental health and even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds and make it to even a semiprofessional level as a standup comedian do you think theres any chance in hell youll be funnier than me    dad is a borderline arena act in some markets have you seen my imdb page im in everything i will fucking crush your career osoto gari your mother and i just spent a fortune to make an agrade blastocyst for them to become a bgrade comedian i will never watch anything you do go to law school   is what my father said to me  i do think its tough for straight men in  to sincerely look up selfimprovement on the internet without five weeks later storming the capitol  that mens selfhelp youtube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now  im not saying its the biggest problem in the world clearly but it is a problem  because men were genetically predisposed to seek selfimprovement  were trying to be better people every day believe it or not women  once we hit a certain age  usually we die before then through suicide or environmental factors bmx biking dietary choices but if you can live long enough as a man you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective  you start seeking guidance from outside sources you start looking at watches   every man in this room has or will at some point weve all been there guys weve all done this weve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives and weve been  what a fucking piece of shit  i fucking hate this loser look at this loser fuck this loser i hate this person i need to be a better person let me start by getting fit   let me work on my health that seems  a logical place to start my journey let me control what i can control in here so what do you do as a man you go on youtube right you look up how to lift weights right you press enter you click on the first video its some guy doing kettlebell swings right hell teach you how to lock your core so you dont break your fucking spine and then you do that for two days you feel pretty good about yourself  whoo right and on the third day the same youtube channel has a new video notification alert the men are  whats this new video from kettlebellswinging guy what could he be doing in his new video in the video the kettlebellswinging guy hes doing the new kettlebell exercise the lawnmower hes doing that and then   seconds into the video he just suddenly just stops and he looks really sad and he puts the kettlebell down and he looks straight into the camera and hes  yo guys just real talk for a second all right  kettlebells are great but i just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind  and all the men watching this are  yeah  yeah that makes sense that feels right in here tell me more kettlebellswinging guy  what other advice do you have for all areas of my life including my relationships and financial investments please give me guidance kettlebellswinging guy so what do you do you watch his next video on autoplay then you watch his next video here comes the youtube algorithm with a suggested video and here comes another suggested video and a week later jordan peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men  five weeks later youre storming the capitol dressed  a buffalo    thats a very realistic sequence of events by the way thats not even an exaggerated timeline every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm we all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that mens selfhelp andrew tate masculinity youtube selfhelp algorithm if you dont know anyone who lost their mind  youre the one who lost their mind youre currently in an echo chamber of assholes cause real friends tell you when youre losing your mind its very tragic all these men who are trying to be better people and theyre seeking guidance but that youtube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves theres tragedy in that  all those people they were just trying to lift weights  they werent trying to cause an insurrection they didnt even know what that word meant they were just trying to do this theyre trying to do this they didnt know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis\\u00e0vis their torso right is it  degrees or  degrees  is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you they googled it one time and then five weeks later youre taking a shit on nancy pelosis desk  and the us marshals are garnishing your wages because you take one wrong turn and life moves pretty quick im not saying as a man dont take responsibility for your own actions  im just saying that youtube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys it it sucks men in in a way that i dont think women understand it really preys on that mens need to seek guidance from somewhere its very hard to resist it just draws draws you in thats why fucking mark zuckerberg is trying to mma fight elon musk right now  that guy fell for his own algorithm do you understand mark zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd and for   years now hes just been looking at our data right jerking off every single day just looking at our data jerking off money piling up billions of dollars data jerking off money money jerking off data for  years that loop and who knew after two decades of that one day he just looked at so much data he was  oh shit oh shit he fell into it now hes trying to mmafight elon musk that guy jerked off and came on his own face   its out of control zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality and he invented that shit and he still fell for it what hope does the average man in america have just walking just waddling down the street looking looking for a taco on his phone hes gonna get sucked into his phone he has no chance that fucking guy has no chance because even the good guys in this room were all  on a razors edge to being a piece of shit   that margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razorthin i gotta tell you if you have the means every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge and  what an instagram post could push it either way   it depends on the post was it cute animals or was it boobs  thats gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours i do think as a society we need to  do a better job of identifying  when we have a disagreement with someone whos genuinely trying to have a goodfaith discussion to reach higher understanding and whos just talking shit we are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit and were not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics  for example me right now im just talking shit   this is oneway shittalking i dont care about any of your opinions do not send me any of them i do not care you paid for me i didnt pay a cent for any of you    free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shittalking session if you dont  it take it out on adam smith but if i was having a conversation with someone i disagree with in good faith i would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with thatd be a logical place to start a difficult conversation for example maga make america great again they have a point americas not doing so great right now right our kids math scores are down  our childrens science scores are down when judged according to international metrics  healthcare systems not doing so great wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially there was an implied promise to a generation of americans that if you do certain things work hard go to college be a good person you would have certain outcomes and those outcomes didnt materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decisionmaking positions lowered the capital gains tax  so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year in postworld war ii us leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for national security by making the us dollar the default international trade currency which gave america the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a us financial banking system but consequently increased the value of the us dollar astronomically which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in america  although the logic at the time  was that americans were supposed to upskill en masse away from the menial manufacturing jobs but everyone heres too much of a dumbass to stay school so we just traded domestic manufacturing to asia and the rest of the world at the expense of workingclass families but if you dont read enough  it comes out as lets go brandon  and its  you have a point but you dont have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didnt read enough you gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag theres a book behind the word you gotta keep going you can go at your own pace but you gotta finish the required reading otherwise we cant have a conversation were all catching up to each other im friends with maga im friends with the magas some of them are my good friends  whoo yeah hawaii maga  the friendliest of all maga  aloha maga theyre in hawaii right now making aloha great again i became friends with them because i filmed two seasons of a tv show in hawaii doogie kame\\u0101loha on disney   maga hawaii welcomed me into their homes ronny please come over please were having a barbecue wed love you to meet the family meet the ohana please wed love to have you over so gracious you show up theyre so warm and welcoming thanks for coming take whatever you want theres some kalua pork theres some loco mocos hot dogs hey here here touch my gun  touch it just touch just take it im always  i i dont want to touch any of these guns  i dont know where theyve been i dont know where theyre going i dont have time in my schedule to attend depositions  just give me the loco moco  very passionate people my maga friends and i respect their passion to some extent i do theyre  i love america i would die for this country and i believe them i believe they love america and i believe they would die for this country which is very admirable but its  man you are willing to die for your country why arent you willing to learn math  also for your country   do both for your country i know you wanna die for your country but were losing the engineering jobs to asia right now so if you we need less people to die for their country we need more people to do their homework for their country  do your homework for your country  actually sit down and show the work and  do the thats a more efficient way to show your patriotism if you take that i want to die energy and you put

thats  the overriding directive that informs the entire decisionmaking tree robocop primary directive do not get scammed do not arrest ocp executive do not get scammed and for chinese baby boomers theres no value proposition  its just pure price sensitivity that means any money outgoing is a scam  if money leaves my possession that was a scam  so the whole time theyre just tensed up theyre just looking for scams when they go out theyre just  they cant even relax scams coming itll be a twodrink minimum over here parking guys tip  tensing up meanwhile koreans in the back just having fun  filipinos dancing  chinese baby boomers just tensed up the further they get from their house as distance x increases they know the fees will increase and so the ex the expenditures are gonna increase so they keep tensing up the further they get until eventually  their whole body tenses up into  a c right  a c for chinese  and then in the back youre  go go have fun have fun they just refuse to have fun  my mom came and visited me in new york city her only son she came to new york city new york city is the kind of city where as soon as you open your front door its    if you touch your door knob

youre embarrassing me in front of the hawaiians mahalo    these chinese baby boomers most scared of being scammed in real life the first to get scammed on the internet for people who live in fear their entire lives extremely gullible because these baby boomers they dont have the they dont have the antibodies to deal with the internet completely clueless when they go on now  watching baby boomers go on the internet now is  watching babies wandering into the kitchen by themselves just looking for cookies on the kitchen countertop just  running their hands blindly on the kitchen countertop pulling down knives kitchen knives coming straight down into their eyeballs into  the soft part of their skull they go in the kitchen they open the oven they turn it on they stick their head inside theyre  any pictures of my grandkids in here is this link safe to click on is this link safe to click on is this link safe to click on just falling for every basic bitch internet scam

misinformation around the world in family group whatsapp chats everywhere everybody just look at this article is this real look at it is this real its how they factcheck they spread it look at this this is a real everybody weigh in im not saying a hair dryer in your mouth will kill covid  but what you cant ask questions anymore look at this article from cnnnnnru quick send it to your uncle send it to your send it to our whole family tree everybody needs to see this has there ever been a dumber generation of idiots more susceptible to fake news than these fucking baby boomers literally believing everything they see on the internet i get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last due to the exponential technology growth curve  but this has got to be the biggest gap in human history the information asymmetry right now is just out of control you literally have people in honolulu right now autodriving their tesla cybertrucks as they vape out the window and their phone ai is trading cryptocurrency meanwhile you have baby boomers they cant even rightclick  they cant even rightclick theres one button how do you rightclick on one button its scary they dont know whats real anymore hey ronny look at this photo of bigfoot shopping at whole foods  bigfoot is real now look theres an image of him buying kombucha at whole foods what technology exists that can fake images im  mom thats not real stop sending it around its not real how do  they always get so indignant about it  how do  that its not real how did  that because the font the font is off and the resolution of the image is blurry and that lighting state doesnt make sense for that image and thats not standard dimensions for a news article i cant give you this knowledge its  malcolm gladwells blink ive seen so much shit on the internet my brain instantly filters it youll never have this skill set so just stay off the internet this world is not for you anymore stop making decisions  but anyway respect your elders  its a confucian value maybe if you give your mom some money she wouldnt get scammed so much yeah well think about the correlation between those two phenomena  people always ask me  why do you shit on your mom for money why dont you shit on your dad for money    no i dont talk about my dad because  my dad has no context for show business  we grew up in malaysia  his families are rubber tappers in malaysia my aunts and uncles are still in sitiawan in malaysia right now tapping rubber they have no context for show business very smart people but they dont know this world my dad he was the first guy in his family to get a college education he went to manchester college which has merged with the university of southern new hampshire he got his masters of economics there put himself through it very smart guy and he was a good immigrant he came to america to new hampshire to get his education and when he graduated he went back to malaysia he didnt take anyones job he left  and my dad had the vision to see what i didnt see he knew he had a ceiling on him because of the way he thinks and talks and he went back to malaysia and he was right for him he went back it was the right choice for him he became a very successful corporate executive  he retired to a farm in johor bahru malaysia love farming he retired to a farm thats how much this guy loved it but he had no context for show business so he wouldnt understand anything im doing  he wouldnt understand what im doing in godzilla vs kong hed be  why dont you just run that way  dad i dont control the edit  im just honolulu chinatown shopkeeper no  in this in this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla  im just connecting act  to act  i dont have a say in how this plays out because of that i stopped telling him about what i was doing i felt he wouldnt get it and he stopped asking me so i didnt tell him i got hired on the daily show he found out the way all parents find out about their kids accolades through a local newspaper so one day the local paper reported that i got hired on the daily show and he called me immediately he was  ronny whats this i hear about you joining the everyday show and i was  oh no its the daily show i joined  two years ago dad he was  oh  well whats the daily show im  its just  another latenight american talk show they kind of invented modern american satire and  and  my dad was  oh thats cool are you the host im  no im a correspondent he was  what is that whats a correspondent im  yeah correspondent is i help the host with comedy segments and he was  oh  hey mei hes just a sidekick  and so he had  no context for what was a win what was a milestone in this industry and so i stopped telling him and he stopped asking me and i didnt need that from him we we were totally fine wed talk about other stuff not about work we werent fighting it was all good  and he passed away very suddenly  in  he died on christmas eve died on his farm  no warning no explanation he just left one day he left so suddenly we had to go back to handle his estate if anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position when you have to handle someone elses estate it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life and so its me my wife my sister brotherinlaw went back to johor bahru and part of me trying to figure out his estate was i had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using so his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it and i opened it up and its passwordprotected and i know this guy so well im  his password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child so  i type in my sisters birthday and spot on spot on it was my sisters birthday  as it should be shes  an anesthesiologist in australia shes  way more respectable person than me actually saving lives  a good person contributing back to society not  this fucking asshole i get in  i get in trouble on the internet for shit i said two years ago every six weeks so it should be her she should be the favorite so i log into his computer i open his web browser i look at his browsing history and the whole time im  please dont let me find my dads porn please dont let me find what positions my dad was into even if it was just missionary i wouldnt be able to handle it im gonna have to burn this laptop for real chinese people when we burn things it goes to our ancestors and then my granddad is gonna see it and its  i dont i dont want that for them ill be fine but theyre gonna have an awkward time im considerate  that  so i open the web browser look at his history and way to go dad no porn what a cleancut guy no porn he only went on the internet twice a day  clockwork  am and  pm  the farmer that he was and every time he went on the internet hed only go to two websites each time so the first website hed go to was a local news website and the second website hed go to twice a day every single day was my twitter page  aw so hed be reloading my twitter page twice a day just to see what i was doing and i post stuff  hey honolulu hawaii i sold out five shows  this week whys there so many homeless people here id post stuff  that  and  he would read that and then hed be  i assume hed be  oh ronnys doing  hes in hawaii he sold out some shows and oh i guess theres a lot of homeless people in hawaii  and  that was his quiet way of keeping up with me he never told me that and i never knew that and we never discussed it  which is a very nice sentiment unfortunately  as best as i can tell this is the last tweet my dad read of mine  so as best as i can tell forensically based on internet browsing timestamps the last tweet my dad read of mine and quite possibly the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm was me posting on twitter if youre a baby boomer on twitter i already know youre a fucking loser  now obviously this was not directed towards him i didnt even know he had twitter i didnt even know he knew what twitter was but i stand by the statement   and i know thats kind of a weird way to end the show but    if its any solace  this was his phone when he died  aw that was his  wallpaper and his screensaver and  and i didnt even know and its a photo of me and my wife and were in hawaii and im wearing two leis cause my mom threw one off and i put it on  and  i didnt know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper  and   i i  to i  to think that  that is the last image he saw of me thats what he remembered me by when he left and  i also would  to tell my sister i won  i won it was me it was me you guys have been great

in  ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for coming  its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that  i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat  shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through and then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its  to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find out  i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books  fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was  the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost   and everybody thought it was  this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was  the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was  you never know when you might need this and i was  but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success i grew up a lot this past year  this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and  hes– hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was  oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was  oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was  all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had  we had we had so much chemistry he was  hey wassup i was  wassup and we– the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was  hey can you drop me off i was  where he was  at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was  oh no i just fucked a homeless dude again my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who   wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they  to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it  because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude  you feel  youre in a wes anderson movie or something and  white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff  voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff  that and its very  its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel  im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement  just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im  i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer  but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you  you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on  my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was  hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its  making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just  a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night  oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre  i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more  loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell  responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding  between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things  host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse   learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up  filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was  its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was  its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total  private school asians we both are big hippies too we  to backpack through southeast asia we  to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit  that  we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes  freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats  a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel  we are white people doing an impression of asian people  we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were  oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i– i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so  i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because  that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre  im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is  shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always  oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you–  you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and  very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be  were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be  we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre  but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do  how much shittier food tastes when  you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be  look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im  that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retired i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day  youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically  wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre  oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks  its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to  squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want  its– its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was  you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently  and he was  hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was  why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes  mrs pacman just lets redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a– im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was   youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really  freaked out about anal and theyre  oh i dont wanna do that im scared of– of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre– if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel  youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt  i got a second chance at life  i was  oh my god its  im going back in time ♪ a whole new world ♪ it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah  a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your– just give your man a little– a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari  and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont– no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they  it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i  that fear that shit turns me on  especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye  hes discovered nirvana and its  youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim  my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when– when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right  i respect you right im  yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who  to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their– glasses always means the woman wants some– its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control   i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live  i just wanna be out of control for once just– just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cunt im just waiting for the right moment to  become a housewife financially  i want my husband to get us to  a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people thats the kind of income bracket im striving for thats when  youve made it when youre eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple  what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking  a princess i have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres– none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be  guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are  thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me  a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were  ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become– youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was  yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won  another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were  why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was  yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed  a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and  why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were  yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn– i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im  oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here  i need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre  im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their– their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are  the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because  im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it– and it scared me  im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbusters i dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im– im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b  skittles so my uterus probably looked  a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act  everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich  mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were  oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats– thats shit you do in your  ok when in– when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was  only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be  were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its  release the kraken and they just come out  a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship  and  yeah and most of the time  we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be  ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look  they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be  hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymore im very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre  oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom– shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was   yeah where im from thats  losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was  no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was  yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was  you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyoncé he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted im scared about giving childbirth though im– im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula  what that is  what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser söze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did  that youre gonna poop on the table i was  yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense  that you– that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channel i can already see how theres  this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommy  i– i– i  i berate my husband on  a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant  your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see  a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then  they get big– they get big  fingers  you you you owe me money you my nipples look  whoppers now and naked i look  a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not  when i was  years old when it was  really hot  and i was  why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my– my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporin so  i– i in– previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos  way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and  two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnant all
